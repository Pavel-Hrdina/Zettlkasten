# [[Meditations]]

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> And when you've read many pages, write out a single place to properly digest them that day. I do that too, and I pick out a single thing from my copious reading.[^Seneca]

Here, you will gather [[ReflectionsTemplate#^193c83|every day]], what has come out of your mind day and night, the thoughts that will help you, when you are at your lowest, the thoughts, that you can come back to, and the thoughts, that you want to keep. You will put them all here, one journal entry in a day, no more no less. If you can't dig [[Wisdom|wisdom]] out of your journal, then go to the next one.

If you **don't agree with what you said in the past, write it here**, if your beliefs have changed, write it here. Question your thoughts, and give them meaning, think about why have you written this, **why have you done this, what was the purpose of writing this**, remind your self every day of your beliefs, and goals. 

## [[2023-Oct-11 - Daily Stoic Reflection]]

And I say, go into nature and let the birds hum bring you to a still as you wonder over life, and suddenly your problems will feel like a needle in a haystack. Let your mind come to a stand still as you let your self come to rest. Sometimes we forget that we are only human and no gods above, deciding the fate of all what is alive and what is not. You are no master of Gaia, let her song guide you, as you walk the path of suffering with pride. Slow down and enjoy her song, for you are still alive.
### Thoughts

Yes, that's right, I can't control what was and what will be, so I shall not let it bother me, I will not succumb to my weakness, and I will find strength in nature. Be well.
