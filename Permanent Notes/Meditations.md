# [[Meditations]]

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> And when you've read many pages, write out a single place to properly digest them that day. I do that too, and I pick out a single thing from my copious reading.[^Seneca]
___

Here, you will gather [[ReflectionsTemplate#^193c83|every day]], what has come out of your mind every day and night, the thoughts that will help you, when you are at your lowest, the thoughts, that you can come back to, and the thoughts, that you want to keep. You will put them all here, one journal entry in a day, no more no less. If you can't dig [[Wisdom|wisdom]] out of your journall, then go to the next one.
