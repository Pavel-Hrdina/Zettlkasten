# [[Meditations]]

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> And when you've read many pages, write out a single place to properly digest them that day. I do that too, and I pick out a single thing from my copious reading.[^Seneca]

Here, you will gather [[ReflectionsTemplate#^193c83|every day]], what has come out of your mind every day and night, the thoughts that will help you, when you are at your lowest, the thoughts, that you can come back to, and the thoughts, that you want to keep. You will put them all here, one journal entry in a day, no more no less. If you can't dig [[Wisdom|wisdom]] out of your journal, then go to the next one.

If you **don't agree with what you said in the past, write it here**, if your beliefs have changed, write it here. Question your thoughts, and give them meaning, think about why have you written this, **why have you done this, what was the purpose of writing this**, remind your self every day of your beliefs, and goals.
