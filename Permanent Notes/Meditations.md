> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> And when you've read many pages, write out a single place to properly digest them that day. I do that too, and I pick out a single thing from my copious reading. [^Seneca]
___

Here, you will gather [[ReflectionsTemplate#^193c83|every day]], what has come out of your mind day and night, the thoughts that will help you, when you are at your lowest, the thoughts, that you can come back to, and the thoughts, that you want to keep. You will put them all here, one journal entry in a day, no more no less. If you can't dig [[Wisdom|wisdom]] out of your journal, then go to the next one.

If you **don't agree with what you said in the past, write it here**, if your beliefs have changed, write it here. Question your thoughts, and give them meaning, think about why have you written this, **why have you done this, what was the purpose of writing this**, remind your self every day of your beliefs, and goals.

And I say, go into nature and let the birds hum bring you to a still, as you wonder over life, and suddenly your problems will feel like a needle in a haystack. Let your mind come to a stand still as you let your self come to rest. Sometimes we forget that we are only human and no gods above, deciding the fate of all what is alive and what is not. You are no master of Gaia, let her song guide you, as you walk the path of suffering with pride. Slow down and enjoy her song, for you are still alive.
### Answer

Yes, that's right, I can't control what was and what will be, so I shall not let it bother me, I will not succumb to my weakness, and I will find strength in nature. Be well.

## [[2023-Oct-14 - Daily Stoic Reflection]]
 *Let your self ride on the waves of life. Listen to the rhythm of life and follow it, listen to humming birds and smell the wind. Life is not a chase after desires but a struggle for survival. So value the things that seem so basic because they could be gone any time*. Now let peace descend onto your heart and become peace once again, rid of Duḥkha. 
### Answer
,,Well tell me, what is the rhythm of life", you might say. Well think about it, what could it be. To say that it is the speed at which time moves, is wrong, time does not have a set speed, you know this, because the speed of time is subjective, everyone feel time differently. ,,So what then is the rhythm of life?" you will argue. It is the speed at which life moves, and the speed of nature, remember, how fast does the leaf turn yellow on trees every autumn, well it's not from day to day, is it? So that is the speed at which you should go, no slower, no faster, and you can only go that fast. If you go any faster, you will burn your self down, if you go any slower, you will not have enough time to do what has to be done, and so, you must learn this speed that nature has set for us. But you might say: ,,How will I have enough time, if I finish things when the leafs turn yellow?". You must, instead of giving your time to everyone, give it to the things, that you deem valuable enough, to take away your time, then you can do things the way they must be done, as the karmic cycle deems necessary. It has taken the Buddha 1000 lifetimes, before he achieved enlightenment, so why do you think, it will take you one day, to do the same.   

## [[2023-Oct-16 - Daily Stoic Reflection]]
Every day, be like a mountain. Unmovable and unbreakable. Be the biggest, harshest mounting, then you will be impossible to climb on. Never let go of your dignity. Never make a fool out of your self. You think that these problems are bad, but you are going to die anyway, so you might as well do your best at it. You can't control the future, let go of worrying about the uncontrollable, it is unwise.  

# [[2023-Oct-20 - Daily Stoic Reflection]]
The future and the past are like a gateless gate, you can see what's inside, but you cannot enter. So do not stare into the gate, for by the time you can enter, there is nothing of what you saw in there.
### Answer
Yes, that is right, future and the past are exactly like that, the more you worry about them, the more pain you bring to your self, yet the things of the past are just that, past, unchangeable, unreachable, and the future in your mind is not real, it's only the creation of your fantasy, and past. Yes, it's tempting to try and see them, yet they are empty like an infinite void, without and end, without any truth to them, so abandon them, they will serve no purpose, other that your mistakes, they will prove usfull, every time you are faced with the same situation again, so use them and their potential, instead of seeing them, as something negative. 

## [[2023-Oct-22 - Daily Stoic Reflection]]
You see the staving homeless on the street, his feet purple and his fingers black. That man is fighting for his life, that is a problem. Now what problems do you really have? You've got a perfect wife, parents, smarts so why are you upset, why do you think that your problems should put you down. **You are not fighting for your life like the man on the street, you are not about to die from terminal illness and even if you were, you would choose the things that are right, you would do your best. So do your best now while you are still alive** and then, when you're dying on that bed, or in the mountains how you wanted, you can say with peace in your heart to those you love: "It's ok, now go and live well for your self this life does not end with me, so go and live happily. Not for me, but for your self.".
### Answer
This means, that you want to be free of burden when you die, this means, that you want to die happy, without attachment, I still believe, that that is the right thing, we all die, so you might as well die happy, and then when you see the mother earth from the mountain down, you will know that the human spirit, cannot be bout by nothing else, that its earthly body, that we have borrowed. Your suffering is not the same as the suffering of those, who are fighting for their life, but that does not mean, that you don't suffer, so instead of putting it down, acknowledge it: "Yes, I am suffering, yes I am in pain, it's part of me, my suffering shall give me strength, my suffering shall give me a reason, to help others, I shall do what I must, and I shall live without regret, for I now, that I could die right now.".

## [[2023-Oct-24 - Daily Stoic Reflection]]
I know, you feel sorry for your self, you feel like a disgrace, like a spit on the face of earth, but a pest a rat lurking about in the shadows. But you are no pest, you are no rat, you are a man, a human! So with this understanding you must see your self as such, you are not a best so act as such, you are no god, so don't play one, you are a man. So go and use what you have been given in birth and do good, make people smile, bring them happiness and the nightmares will be gone, the self-doubt will be gone, and you will feel whole again, for this curse you have demands you to be this way and fighting against it will only bring you suffering. 
### Answer
There is nothing more to add, you are a man, you make mistakes, you must follow your [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], you choose to be good, and you choose to be loving.

## [[2023-Oct-25 - Daily Stoic Reflection]]
 Don't fight things that you can't control. The only thing that you can control, and you will understand this the more you try to control things, is [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md). It is the only thing in our control, and it's ok that way. You can't really control the outcome of anything else. Sometimes you can't even control your self. That is the beauty of life, that you can't control anything. You ask: "But why is it beautiful?". Well would life be exiting if all things had a simple solution, just like that you snap your fingers and all is great, no that is boring really. So be the spectator of the events around you once you take action, for that is when you can't control the outcome anymore.  
### Answer
The man that thinks he is in control, is the man that will fall the hardest, when he is about to die.
