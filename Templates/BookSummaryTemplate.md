## Answer the following Four Questions as Best as You Can

To be able to answer these questions shows that you have at least some understanding of the book. If you can’t answer them, you probably haven’t quite paid attention well enough. Also, it’s my opinion that you should actually write (or type) these answers out. Consider it to be like a book journal. It’ll stay with you and become much more ingrained than if you just answer them in your head.

### 1. What is the Book About, as a Whole?

### 2. What is Being Said in Detail, and How?

### 3. Is the Book True, in Whole or in Part?

### 4. What of It? What’s the Significance?
