Sometimes to solve a [Problem](Problem%20Solving%20), you have to **stop looking for a solution to it**. Instead, think about the problem itself, you must shift your view of it and your approach to it. Take a pause and think, is this the right problem. Reframing is in a way like [Thinkig out of the Box](Thinkig%20out%20of%20the%20Box). The method used when reframing is called [Rapid Reframing Medhod](Rapid%20Reframing%20Medhod).
