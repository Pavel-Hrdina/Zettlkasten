Sometimes to solve a [Problem](Problem%20Solving%20), you have to **stop looking for a solution to it**. Instead, think about the problem itself, you must shift your view of it and your approach to it. Take a pause and think, is this the right problem. Reframing is in a way like [Thinkig out of the Box](Thinkig%20out%20of%20the%20Box). The method used when reframing is called [Rapid Reframing Medhod](Rapid%20Reframing%20Medhod).

The loop starts here... So how to actually reframe??? The goal is to step out of the box and challenge the 1st problem you created while 1st [Framing](Framing.md). You can use the following as a check list:  

1. **Look outside the frame.** What are we missing?
2.  **Rethink the goal.** Is there a better objective to pursue?
3. **Examine bright spots.** Where is the problem not?
4. **Look in the mirror. **What is my/our role in creating this problem?
5. **Take their perspective.** What is their problem?

Repeat the loop. If you find a solution for your problem you move forward an solve it.

## Personal Attachment

[Problem](Problem%20Solving%20) reframing is the 1st step to solve the right problem, if you can do that, you will solve the problem in a better way.
