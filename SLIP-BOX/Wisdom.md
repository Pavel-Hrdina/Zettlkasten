Wisdom is what the ancient [Taoism](Taoists) called [Wu Wei](Wu%20Wei), or the path. It is the ability to live according to nature. Its speed, its cycles and its ways. It is the ability to be at peace and to just be and live without the need and without the speed. 

## Personal Attachment

Wisdom is the most important trait for living. The ancient [Stoics](Stoicism.md) first came up with this concept.
