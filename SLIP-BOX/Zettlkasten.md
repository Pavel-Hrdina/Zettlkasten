Zettlkasten is a note taking system created in the 20th century. It was ment to be used with physical notes, but it works suprisngly well with digital onec as well. The main idea of Zettlkasten is creating hyperlinked notes in your [[Personal knowledge management]]. 

It works on creating multiple so called [[Fleeting Notes]] these are later combined into [[Permanet Notes]] these can be then used for creating a finel note in any of your fucking bulhity projects that you never finish aniway you twat.
