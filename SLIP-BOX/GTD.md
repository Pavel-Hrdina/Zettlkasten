GTD (**Getting Tthings Done**) is a [[Framework]] for task management and productivity created by David Alan. Its a [[System]] for collecting any kind of [[Task]], [[Ideas]] and [[Projects]] and getting it done fast. The [[System]] assumes that you are a dump ass that forgets things on daily basis.

GTD works on the basis of list, **task list** there are these lists:

1. **[[In List]]**

2. **[[Next actions]]** (probably several)

3. **[[Waiting for]]**

4. **[[Projects]]**

5. **[[Some day/maybe List]]**

If you want to manage your task in a **simple, yet organized** way, this is it.
