GTD (**Getting Tthings Done**) is a [[Framework]] for task management and productivity created by David Alan. Its a [[System]] for collecting any kind of [[Task]], [[Ideas]] and [[Projects]] and getting it done fast. The [[System]] assumes that you are a dump ass that forgets things on daily basis.
