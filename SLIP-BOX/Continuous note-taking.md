Continuous note-taking is a implementation of [[Continuous Improvement]] and [[Agile]] practices used in [[Software Development]] and [[Software Testing]] in [[Personal knowledge management]].

It uses the following methods:

- Note improvement can happen and should happen over a long period of time. 

- The note should have its place among all the notes in the system and should be connected to other notes in some way.
