Stoicism is a [[School of Thought]] that started in ancient Greece about 2000 years ago. The Stoics thought, that the only thing **we have control over are our own judgments and nothing else**.  The goal is to develop a right attitude to the external while keeping [[Control Over Judgment]]. Stoicism also encourages to maintain control over **negative** emotions, just like [[Buddhism]], this way, we control our judgment. Furthermore the stoic say that **our [[Stoic Emotions]] are the product of our [[Control Over Judgment | judgment]]**.
