Stoicism is a [[School of Thought]] that started in ancient Greece about 2000 years ago. The Stoics thought, that the only thing **we have control over are our own judgments and nothing else**.  The goal is to develop a right attitude to the external while keeping [[Control Over Judgment]]. Stoicism also encourages to maintain control over **negative** emotions, just like [[Buddhism]], this way, we control our judgment. Furthermore the stoic say that **our emotion are the product of our [[Control Over Judgment | judgment]]**.

The Stoics **try to avoid anger** as much as they possibly can, even describing it as temporary madness. _Being so angry that one can no longer resist the urge to hit someone is quite another matter, and this is what the Stoics want to avoid_. The person who feels an emotion but does not let it control him in a healthy way, that mean not pushing against it letting it come and go, is a person that is not effected by the emotion, because he is in control. The emotion you feel at first is called a _first movement_.
