The process of making book notes, starts in the [Kindle](Kindle), it is advised to highlight each chapter title. You can also **highlight what you think is important**, and add **notes to the book directly**. It's also great to have page number references in resulting kindle clippings. 

[The video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3dbH2c3l0M)** advices a complicated ** and hard to use method** for exporting [Kindle](Kindle) clipping into obsidian, I find it too time-consuming, so I will rather think harder on what to highlight, that highlighting too much, same goes for notes. 

It's a good idea to add drawings to the book notes for clearer and faster review. You can also create a **[Literature note The Compound Effect](Literature%20note%20The%20Compound%20Effect.md)** if you want to, create smaller drawings so you can later put them all together into one big [Book on a Page](Book%20on%20a%20Page).

Taking good notes on a book will help me remember it while [[Reading]] and after [[Reading]] it.
