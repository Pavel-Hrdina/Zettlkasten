Pareto principle states that 80% of work of done in 20% of time or that 80% of x happens in 80% of y. If you use this principle correctly you can master almost anything in no time even [Vim](Vim.md). 

## Personal attachment 

This principle helps me understand [Note Taking](Note%20Taking) more and how to work and when to work the hardes and when the smartes. This principle also justifies [Continuous note-taking](Continuous%20note-taking.md).
