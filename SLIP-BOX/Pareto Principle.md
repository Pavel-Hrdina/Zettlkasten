Pareto principle states that 80% of work of done in 20% of time or that 80% of x happens in 80% of y. If you use this principle correctly you can master almost anything in no time even [[Vim]]. 

## Personal attachment 

This principle helps me understand [[Note Taking]] more and how to work and when to work the hardes and when the smartes. This principle also justifies [[Continuous note-taking]].
