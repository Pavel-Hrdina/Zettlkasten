The absolute basic matcher, as is shown in [[Regex type system]] is just a simple **word** that the sentence contains. Another essential thing is picking the whole sentence, this can be useful when manipulating the text afterwards, here is an example:

```regex
/./g 
```

Then there are the character sets. This means that you can chose multiple words that differ, for example, in one character only for this we use *[some charaters her]*. Here is and examaple, fuck:

```regex
/ b[abcd]r /g
```

Then there is fucking string negation ahhhhh. This means that the string will not be included. Its done using *[^]*. Notice that you can combine this with the previous example. Exmaple bitches:

```regex
b[^eo]r
```

Then there is a way to include a rang of letters. For this we use *-*. Common this is basic shit I don't need to explain this to you. Exaampleee:

```regex
[e-o]
```

There is more. For now you are in lessen nine of regexlearn

This is the essential basic shit, if you don't know it you are screwed and your time is more like shit in the sewer.
