Control over ones own judgment is the absolute basis of all [Stoic](Stoicism%20) [Philosophy](Philosophy). This is done, by maintaining absolute focus over the judgement and  going with the flow, **controlling what I can control**. It is secured by using [Stoic](Stoicism%20) tools: [Morning Reflection](Reflections), [Evening Reflection](Reflections) and the [Gravestone Method](Gravestone%20Method).

## Personal Attachment

If I want to practice [Stoicism](Stoicism.md), I have to be a master of of my own judgment
