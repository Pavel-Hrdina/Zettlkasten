Control over ones own judgment is the absolute basis of all [ Stoic](Stoicism%20) [Philosophy](Philosophy). This is done, by maintaining absolute focus over the judgement and  going with the flow, c**ontrolling what I can control**. It is secured by using [ Stoic](Stoicism%20) tools: [Morning Reflection](Morning%20Reflection), [Evening Reflection](Evening%20Reflection)
