> It’s important to note that reframing is different from analyzing a problem. Analysis, as I use the term here, is when you ask, **Why is the elevator slow?** and try to understand the various factors that influence the speed. Being good at analysis is about being precise, methodical, detail-oriented, and good with numbers.

It is more about seeing the big picture and having the ability to consider situations from multiple perspectives.
