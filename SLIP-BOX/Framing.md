Framing and [ Reframing](Reframing%20the%20Problem%20) can be done anytime when working on a specific [ Problem](Problem%20Solving%20)

> It’s important to note that reframing is different from analyzing a problem. Analysis, as I use the term here, is when you ask, **Why is the elevator slow?** and try to understand the various factors that influence the speed. Being good at analysis is about being precise, methodical, detail-oriented, and good with numbers.

> Reframing, in comparison, is a higher-level activity. It is when you ask, **Is the speed of the elevator the right thing to focus on?** Being good at reframing is not necessarily about the details. It is more about seeing the big picture and having the ability to consider situations from multiple perspectives.
