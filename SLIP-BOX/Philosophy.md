Philosophy is a study of the fundamental questions of life itself like: *"Why are we here?"* or *"What is the purpose of life"*. Notable philosophies that I like are: [Stoicism](Stoicism.md), [Buddhism](Buddhism) and [Minimalism](Minimalism). There are many others but their are not of any worth to me at the moment or concern.

## Personal Attachment

Philosophy is a way of giving meaning to life, if you believe in a philosophy you gain structure a meaning to something that has none.
