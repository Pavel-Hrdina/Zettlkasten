The [Stoic](Stoicism%20) view on adversity is a challenge. Every adversity is an opportunity for growth. When a disaster strikes, your character is molded, you become virtuous. The stoics even take it a step further, they say that **a person who doesn't experience an adversity develops bad character** and has problem controlling his judgment. It is I, who chooses to see an event as a **disaster**, or as an **opportunity**

The main idea here is that one should be prepared for a disaster. No awaiting it but being prepared in his mind for it. **_Epictetus counsels that we pay minimal attention to such events, instead keeping our focus squarely on our own judgments._**

> [!quote] Seneca
> Just as a general will only send his finest soldiers into the most 
> difficult battles, so too will God send the toughest challenges only
> to the most worthy individuals.
> **And**
> ...whatever adversity life throws at us will always be an opportunity to learn something about ourselves and to improve our characters...

Having the right judgment when faced with a difficulty is essential to having the right [ judgment](Control%20Over%20Judgment%20).
