Linux, is an [Open Source](Open%20Source.md) [Operating System](Operating%20System) [Kernel](Kernel) with a **30 years of history**. it is a base for many [ operating systems](Operating%20System%20), that are running on top of it. 

Linux is normally thought of as a standalone [Operating System](Operating%20System), but this is not exactly right as Linux [ operating systems](Operating%20System%20), commonly called [Linux distributions](Linux%20distributions.md), or [ distros](Linux%20distributions%20) for short, consist of the [GNU Project](GNU%20Project) tooling and [Command line](Command%20line) utilities that allow the user to use the system from the [Tty](Tty) or the [Command line](Command%20line), but most modern [ distros](Linux%20distributions%20) come with a [GUI](GUI) interface. 

Linux is mainly managed through so called **[ commands](Linux%20commands.md)**. These speed up the process of [System Management](System%20Management) brutally in some cases, but they must be learned and understood. 

## Personal Attachment

Linux is the best operating system there is. There are no restrictions when it comes to what you can do, yet it can be used without a hustle, if you chose to do so.
