Linux, is an [[Open Source]] [[Operating System]] [[Kernel]] with a **30 years of history**. it is a base for many [[Operating System | operating systems]], that are running on top of it. 

Linux is normally thought of as a standalone [[Operating System]], but this is not exactly right as Linux [[Operating System | operating systems]], commonly called [[Linux distributions]], or [[Linux distributions | distros]] for short, consist of the [[GNU Project]] tooling and [[Command line]] utilities that allow the user to use the system from the [[Tty]] or the [[Command line]], but most modern [[Linux distributions | distros]] come with a [[GUI]] interface. 

Linux is mainly managed through so called **[[Linux commands| commands]]**. These speed up the process of [[System Management]] brutally in some cases, but they must be learned and understood. 

## Personal attachment 

Linux is the best operating system there is. There are no restrictions when it comes to what you can do, yet it can be used without a hustle, if you chose to do so.
