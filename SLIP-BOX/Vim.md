Vim is a [Text Editor](Text%20Editor) that work entirely in in command line and uses characters as means of getting command from the user. Its elegant, simple and extendable and is as old as computers. That means that if it breaks. its my fault. Vim calls its command [Vim Movements](Vim%20Movements.md).

The main things that make vim different from other editors are: [Vim Modal Editing](Vim%20Modal%20Editing.md) and [Vim Operators](Vim%20Operators.md)

## Personal Attachment

Vim help experienced users that can type with all 10 fingers really fast, and I mean ridiculously fast.
