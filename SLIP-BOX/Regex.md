Regex means *`"regular expressions"`*. You use it to match, find or manege text. It is the lazy way of doing this shit, you can either match strings by hand or use regex. It is [ typed](Regex%20type%20system.md) so no need to use your mouse like a fucking monkey. 

You can also think of them as strings or characters that you use to search for a particular word.


## Personal attachment 

Regex is great for managing [rss feeds](rss%20feeds). You can directly say what is it you want and there is no need for hustle.
