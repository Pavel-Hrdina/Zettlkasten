Cronjobs are a way to create a so called _"hooks"_ that make it possible to automate task at set times. There also exist a so called [ Crontabs](Crontab%20), these are user specific but are the same as cronjobs in general.

## Personal attachment 

Cronjobs are great for general [Linux](Linux.md) task automation so that I don't have to remember to run these things.
