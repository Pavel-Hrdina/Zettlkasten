Motivation is killed by anxiety. **Don't duplicate others**, it won't work you will burn out. Motivation does not mean  _'just do it'_.  Motivation is destroyed by  thought bumping against each other like a [ ball replacing a smaller balls place](../Assets/Excalidraw/Drawing%202023-08-25%2020.56.05.excalidraw.svg) by bouncing into it. **The key to motivation is keeping the thoughts form bumping**. But how?? Remind your self of your goal and keep it in your mind. 

The mind has mechanisms that try to motivate you do something for example [Procrastination](Procrastination), but they often don't work.

If you want to finish what you start, you need to remain motivated to do so.
