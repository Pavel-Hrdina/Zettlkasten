Installing from source often requires the larger [Software](Software.md) tooling than is used to build the software it self. But there are tools that help you get software tailored to you needs and [ optimized ](Optimalizition%20) for your needs. One of these tools for example is [ gentoos](Getoos%20) [Emerge](Emerge) package manager, that build everything form source. 

There exist general guidelines for building [Software](Software.md) from source. But it is advised to use the [Documentation](Documentation) duh, just make sure to follow that and you will be fine. **Don't try to look it up**, any problem you might have is not a bug but a problem with missing packages, _usually_ at least. 

I my self don't build software on anything that is not [Linux](Linux.md) based as it can become hard to do so. If you run it-to [ Problems](Problem%20Solving%20) that, make sure to **CHECK THE [ DOCUMENTATION](Documentation%20)!!**.
