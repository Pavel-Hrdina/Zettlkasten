Installing from source often requires the larger [[Software]] tooling than is used to build the software it self. But there are tools that help you get software tailored to you needs and [[Optimalizition | optimized ]] for your needs. One of these tools for example is [[Getoos | gentoos]] [[Emerge]] package manager, that build everything form source. 

There exist general guidelines for building [[Software]] from source. But it is advised to use the [[Documentation]] duh, just make sure to follow that and you will be fine. **Don't try to look it up**, any problem you might have is not a bug but a problem with missing packages, _usually_ at least. 

I my self don't build software on anything that is not [[Linux]] based as it can become hard to do so. If you run it-to [[Problem Solving | Problems]] that, make sure to **CHECK THE [[Documentation | DOCUMENTATION]]!!**.
