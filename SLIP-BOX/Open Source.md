> Open source software is not to be confused with [Free Software](Free%20Software)

Open source software, is publicly available to copy and modify. This type of [Software](Software.md) can be contributed to. Great open source software includes: [Linux](Linux.md), [Vim](Vim.md) and many others.

## Personal Attachment

If you think its free, its not. Anyway its better than those  subscription based services that you pay inhumane amounts of money just to do something you can do for free and however you want.
