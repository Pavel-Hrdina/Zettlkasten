The in list is the **brain dump** list that you put all the incoming tasks into. The only thing to remember here is the question ***Do I need to do this?***. If its no, just don't do it or put it in the [Some day/maybe List](Some%20day/maybe%20List), simple.

If the task is to be done, then ask ***Whats next?*** 

## Personal Attachment

The most basic list in [GTD](GTD.md) and the starting point for me.
