The Stoics **try to avoid anger**, and other negative emotions, as much as they possibly can, even describing it as temporary madness. _Being so angry that one can no longer resist the urge to hit someone is quite another matter, and this is what the Stoics want to avoid_. The person who feels an emotion but does not let it control him in a healthy way, that mean not pushing against it letting it come and go, is a person that is not effected by the emotion, because he is in control. The emotion you feel at first is called a _first movement_. 

The [[Stoicism | Stoics]] claimed that there are 3 stages to negative emotions:

1. **First Movement**
	This stage can't be controlled, there is nothing I can do about it. 
2. **Judgment**
	This stage can be controlled and is crucial to avoid the **negative** emotion
3. **Emotion**
	Ones in this stage, there is nothing one can do but accept the emotion and wait. 

## Personal Attachment

This is a big part of [[Stoicism]] as it helps to gain further control over what we can control, that is my [[Control Over Judgment | judgment]].
