[Regex] is typed, like most thing, in human language. Well no shit. Here is an example of a regex statement:

```regex
/ OK /g
```

This simple statement will pick the word OK form a sentence, if the word it self is there. It will search the text for this particular word. You get it, nice! This is one of the [Basic matchers](Basic%20matchers.md) we can use.

There exist more [Advanced ways to use regex](Advanced%20ways%20to%20use%20regex.md) but that is too much for your monkey brain.

If you don't know how its used you don't know shit.
