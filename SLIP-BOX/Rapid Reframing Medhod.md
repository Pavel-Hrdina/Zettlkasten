1. The first step to reframe any problem is, you guessed it [Framing](Framing).
2. The second step is [Analyzing the Problem](Analyzing%20the%20Problem)
3. And last part is [Solving the Problem](Solving%20the%20Problem)

There are 2 different ways to look at a problem 

1. **Exploring the frame**: that is when you look at the problem you already have in more detail 
2. **Breaking the frame**: that is when create an entirely different perspective at the actual problem.

It is very important that you **ask the right questions**. This is a method used to reframe the problem. It uses a tool called [The Reframing Canvas](The%20Reframing%20Canvas). it's also important to **stay optimistic**
