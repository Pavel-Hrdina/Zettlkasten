Reading is one of the most important things you could ever learn... but the questions remain: "How to read faster?", "How to read better?", "How to [remember what I have read](Remember%20What%20you%20Read.md)?" and so on. But the actual challenge is **starting to read**. This is the 1st and most important thing about reading. Go and read.
