Reading is one of the most important things you could ever learn... but the questions remain: "How to read faster?", "How to read better?", "How to [[Remember What you Read|remember what I have read]]?" and so on. But the actual challenge is **starting to read**. This is the 1st and most important thing about reading. Go and read.
