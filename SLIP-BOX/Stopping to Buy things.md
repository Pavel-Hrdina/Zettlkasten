To follow [[Minimalism]], it's advised to stop buying things, you can accomplish this by:

1. **Waiting it out**
	A good rule here is to buy the thing you want, only if you still want it after 30 days of waiting, if you don't want it then you probably don't need it.

## Personal Attachment

When you buy only what you need, you become happier and more satisfied in life
