To follow [Minimalism](Minimalism.md), it's advised to stop buying things, you can accomplish this by:

1. **Waiting it Out**
	A good rule here is to buy the thing you want, only if you still want it after 30 days of waiting, if you don't want it then you probably don't need it.
2.  **Make a Pros and Cons List**
	If you just cannot wait, make a pros and cons list, this will make it clean to if you really care about the thing you're buying, 
3. **Avoid Subscriptions and Temptations**
4. **Find a Hobby**
	Even if hobbies cost money, they are worth it long term, and they will keep you from buying what is unnecessary, hell you might even build something nice.
