Each letter must instantly provide a memorable character who can become part of a lively story associated with whatever you’re trying to remember.


This is my [[Visual Alphabet]]:

## Personal Attachment

This is a great way of remembering a list of imformation, that you need to remember. It's simple once you get the hang of it, when you create your "hooks" for the imformation.
