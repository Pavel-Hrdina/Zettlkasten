Welcome to my [Zettlkasten](Zettlkasten.md). Here is where I dump all my knowledge, my note, and whatever else I want to store, so I don't have to remember. **I have declared a bankruptcy on my memory**, which is why I have decided to store all my notes in the simplest way possible, which is by writing the notes in [Markdown](Markdown), in [Obsidian](Obsidian), as its the simplest option for me. The notes should also be compatible with _normal_ [Markdown](Markdown), so they render nicely anywhere in anything.   

**Some notes are not directly linked to each other**, as there is no natural place for them to be linked to. All links should be created naturally without forcing connections. That's why **all notes have tags** that connect them when searching. 

This way, there is **no need for the note to be forced linked to**, and at the same time the note is easily found, when its name is forgotten or the note can't be found. The goal is to **keep the system as simple as possible** while remaining extremely efficient without sacrificing the ease of use and creating complexity.
