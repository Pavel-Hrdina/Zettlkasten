## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You are likely to be cold, sick, tired, sad and angry. You might also meet people who are arrogant, ungrateful, mean, angry. You might also feel the need to give up, but you must never give up and never back down. All of these things need to be approached with kindness and compassion, with loving heart and loving mind. But how should I be loving, when I'm tired? Well practice the loving speech to your self and others, practice the breath method, and then you will see the results of your love.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to learn for the tests again. You shall do this once you come home, and you will, because I believe in you, I believe that you can do this, that you can win over your self.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, for my wife, for my sister, for being alive, for having warm food every day, for having warmth, for having enough, for being me, for love, for peace and for trust. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You might be worried once again that you can't do this,  that you are not enough, that you are but a joker, an imposter. But remember 1 minute of right practice is worth 1 hour of wrong practice. Bear in mind that these toxic thoughts are there to make you suffer, to make you suffer so that you have to live. But think, wouldn't it be better to make these thoughts kind and be happier then?
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how bad life might seem, no matter what is happening to you right now, no matter how much you suffer, no matter what, you must push forward, you must choose the path that leads to happiness, even if it's harder, you must do what is right and you must be good. I know that sometimes you feel like you can't make it, but don't give in to your demons, let them go will love and then be in peace, for nothing can hurt you, if you are like a wall from iron, so hard that nothing may destroy it. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. Other things are unchangeable in their nature and so, if you know this, you must do what ordeal you have been given by nature to do, you are not alone in theis world and you must do your part every single day, every single night, without a pause, without a break, only to sleep, because what else is your purpouse than that that is naturall and yours only to bear.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

You learned for the test. You did this in order to push your self harder, to the things that must be done, no matter what, to be the best.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

You got stressed even when you shouldn't have, you weren't focused enough. You did this, because you lost your self to the world and abandoned your inner citadel. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

You did all that you set to do today.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
