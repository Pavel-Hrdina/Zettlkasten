## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may feel like you have failed your self, you may not be able to speak, and you may not be able to do what you want to do, you may feel like you are loosing time and that you can't do anything right. You may meet people that are mean, angry, aggressive and unhappy. You must face all of these difficulties head on and never let them put you down, never let them make you feel bad or even worthless. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to heal your self and your soul, for that is what needs to be done today, no worries shall plague your mind and not hate shall put you down, for a healthy mind results in a good life, in order to be able to communicate with your reason to make the right [[Control Over Judgment|Judgments]], you need your mind to be calm like the wings 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. I am grateful for my parents. They love me unconditionally, and they are always here for me, they gave me the gift of life and help me with my path in life, so that I do what is right and what should be done to live a good life. 
	2. I am grateful for my wife. She loves the way I am, and she is kind to me. She supports me, no matter what I choose to do. She taught me, that no matter how much suffering you may be feeling, you must still choose to live and to accept what you have with gratitude. 
	3. I am grateful for my sister, for books, for my mentors, for people that love me, for people that support me, for people that help for wisdom for being me and for being alive. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you are loosing time, that you are not doing enough, that you are lacking behind and that you are not doing enough that you can't do what is right, but instead of thinking like this, think, what is the true worth of these thoughts? What do they bring you, what do they teach you, and how do they make you a better person? Well they don't do any of these things, so abandon them, leave them be and let peace come into your soul. ,,But how?", you may be asking. Think about these worries and then let them go, let them flout out of your heart like water flows down the river. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how dark might think appear, you must choose to push forward and every time you fall down, every time you fail, every time you must get back up, for that is what you can control, you may fail, see people die, meet people that are mean and what not, but instead of complaining about tehese things you can't controll, instead choose to let these thing go and focus on what is essential. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only things withing my controll is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and nothing else is, so choose to use it to take action.  

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events

How I see them in the near future?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus
