## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may have to fight for your self, you may have to use violence, you may be cold, and you may feel lazy, you may be challenged and think about giving up, you may feel bad and unhealthy, you may meet people that will try to hurt you, people that are manipulative, angry, aggressive, arrogant and ungrateful. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to work on the project base, give in a deep thought and then do it.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I choose to be grateful for my parents, for my wife, for my sister, for being me, for being alive, for having enough, for kindness, for love, for understanding, for knowledge, for being me, for peace, for doing what I believe is right, for understanding and wisdom.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you can't do anything right, that you are lost, that you don't know what to do, that you can't defend your self, that you are too kind, that you are too loving, that by being your self, you make people go away, that by being who you really are, people won't like you. Don't you see that these things make no sense, don't you see that they are not true? And so what if people hate you, so what if they despise you, be happy, don't worry about them, what can you do about them except let them be and not talk with them. Choose to let go of these worries, face them, fearless, not attacking them, but instead, showing them love and compassion, then you won't be suffering anymore. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how hard thing might seem, you must keep pushing on, you must push for that light at the end of the tunnel, you must choose happiness, over pain, you must choose to do the same things over and over again in order to achieve your goals. I know that it's hard, I know that you feel a lot of emotions, but you must choose to accept them in your self, you must choose to love them, even if they are painful, don't try to banish them, just let them be, love them for what they give you, be grateful for them. You have the power to love people, so love them, if they try to hurt you don't talk with them.  
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing that is within my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. So choose to use it to take action. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
