## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	1. - I am likely to meet mean and angry people. I will react to them calmly and with loving kindness. I will not let their anger consume me as it did them.
	2. - I am likely to experience bad traffic. If this will be the case, I will accept that there is nothing I can do about it and go on.
	3. - I am likely to stop focusing. If this will be so, I will realize that I am sleepwalking and then gently start focusing again.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	1. - Today I must finish what is yet undone.
3. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. - I am grateful for my parents, my wife, the nature, trees, grass, air that I breathe, the sun, the earth, the kind, peace, democracy, my home, my country, being alive, having internet, having books. I am grateful for all of these things that may appear as normal, yet without them, I would be lost or dead. 
4. **What is worrying me?**
	1. - I am worried that I will become lazy. 
	2. - I am worried that I don't have enough time on this earth to live.
5. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	1. - When your mind is as dark as the night sky, search for the stars that light shines through. These beacons of hope, even if small, will give you a way to keep going. Even thought things may be taught, you will prevail if you make good. 
6. **What is within my control and what is not**
	1. - My [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md) is under my control.
	2. - I am under my control.
	3. - Everything else is not under my control, so don't force things to do what you want they to, because they are impossible to control. Go with Gaias rhythm and you will be at peace.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| - I was at peace today | - I felt so, because I had no worried, nothing is worth worrying about |
|  - I was kind to all | - I did this to be happy |
| - I am doing what I feel is right | - I am doing this to become better long term |
| - I am disciplined long term | - This is a great achievement for me |

When the day seems lost, and you feel that it does not matter what you do. Remember the good you did, even the little thing and tomorrow improve on them, make more good, and you will soon be rid of this worry. I thank you for doing these things. I am very happy for you.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| - Today I was lazy | - I did this because I had no energy |

Be like a rock that won't move for ages. Let the simplicity flow with you as you are like that rock. Even if you stay in place, you know that time is the only teacher and nothing can be rushed.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| - Wake up rested | - I didn't do it because I didn't listen to my self and went to sleep late |

The things that are undone are still possible to do. Do not let these things drag you down. You can do them tomorrow, and you can try again until you have it right. Nothing is perfect and that is the way of mother Gaia, it's how you flow with life. Let things be imperfect let them have small fault, barely noticeable do not strive for perfection, and you will find  that these things that are imperfect have the biggest value to you and others. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
