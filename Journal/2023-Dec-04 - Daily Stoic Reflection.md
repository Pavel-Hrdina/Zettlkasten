## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You may meet people that are mean, unkind, mad, ugly, arrogant, ungrateful, unhappy, you may be cold, you may feel pain, you may be hungry, and you may be put under pressure. Accept these things the way they are, don't fight them, don't let them disturb you and your calm, your peace.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- You must, after you come home, take 80 minutes of your time and learn for the tests. You must do this at 15:00 today.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- Thank the universe for my parents, for my wife, for, being alive, for being me, for having warm food every day, for knowing my worth, for being resilient, for knowing when to let go and for being warm and having a place to sleep.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried about time, about people, about the weather, about the traffic, about your self. Now, what worth do these worries have for you? How are they helping you do the right tings? They aren't doing any of these things, they only plague your mind and spread like mushrooms. If you know this, let go of them.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter what you might be going thought right now, remember how lucky you are to be alive, how precious life is and how much, how much pain have you already overcame, how much you have got thought by your self. Remember the lesson and never give up, never back down, never hunch, never be broken. No matter what, you musn't give up on the things you have under your controll.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only things under your conrol is your [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md). So use it to take action, to help the suffering and to help you self and do what you belive is right.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today you did all the things that you set out to do, you were kind to your self and others, you resisted your temptations, you eate the frog, you did what you set out to do. This is a great leap forward for you, I know its hard for you to do the things that you belive take away your freedom, but if they must be done; they are your duty, then you must do them and you did. You did all of these things to become happier to become more peacefull to live a better life. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

I did some things, like lose controll of my emotions, and therefore I lost controll over my own [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md). You weren't paying attention for a moment and then you do things that you regret afterwards.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

I did all that had to be done.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
