## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You may be cold, you may be sick, you may feel slow, you may feel dumb, and you may feel lost, you may feel bad overall, you may feel overwhelm, you may be unable to act, you may feel, as if you had no time, as if you couldn't do anything, you may be stuck in a trafic jam, you may be stressed, and you may have no time for the things you want to do. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to do, what is your duty, so do it. Think about what has to be done, think about, what you must do, think about what bothers you, and think, about the things you need to do.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my wife, for my mother, for being me, for being alive, for knowledge, for trust, for love, for my father, for my family, for my ancestors, for being loved, for being trusted.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- That I will fail, that I can't face my fear, that I am weak.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- So what that you will fail, so what that you will die, so what? Instead of thinking your self week, think instead, focus on your fear, and know that fear is a little mind killer, that fear you feel, let it go thought you, remember the mantra against fear, and you will be at peace.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing under my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], so I choose to use it to take actions.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

	Today, I did all the things that I set out to do, and that I could do. 

1. **What did I do wrong?**

	I was gaming too much. 

2. **What duty remains undone?**

	Learning.

3. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

	Tomorrow, I must choose to discard my fears.

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
