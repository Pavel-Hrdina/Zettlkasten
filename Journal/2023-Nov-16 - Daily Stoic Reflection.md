## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- I might meet people who are suffering greatly, that are envious, unhappy, negative and aggressive. I might be cold and feel bad for my self, I might encounter traffic and I might be a laughed at. All these things might happen to strengthen me, to strengthen my resolve to help me, and so I shall be loving, patient and calm to them, I chose not to explode with rage against them, I chose to not blame them for my misfortune, I chose to blame my own decision and improve them for the future, I chose to control and influence what I can. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to read and shall do so.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my mother, my father, my family, my loved ones, warm food every day, being healthy, being alive, being warm, being me, having all teeth, having all limbs, being mentally stable, being hardened, knowing when to act, my mentors and my teachers. I am grateful for all of these things that I have been granted, and I shall not let them go to waste, I thank for all of them and more. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that there is no time, that I am weak, that I can't do what I want to do, that I will fail my self, that I am not enough, that I am lazy, that I will fail others, that I am wrong, that I was not meant to be born, that I get distracted easily. No, thing to your self: "How real are these worries? Why do you think they are reality? Are they real according to nature?". Your answers are not am I right; so let go of these ideas in your head that plague your mind, let them go with the wind, let them float away peacefully from your mind like the flower lets its seeds be taken by the wind with peace and grace, let life be natural, let life be slow and don't try harder, just let things be the way they happen. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You, mighty friend, might think that you are useless, that you have no place among people. But you can be with anybody and talk about anything, isn't that something, you improve your self every day and do what is natural, isn't that something? Well, you are already stronger than most modern men, so think again about your weakness, for you are no weakling. Think: "I am still alive, I am not dead.", think about the things that are essential, think about the ways you can take action and you will realize the truth. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], do you understand, you have to take action, it doesn't mean that you shall stay idle, it means that you control your own actions. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Even thought I am sick, I pushed my self harder that yesterday. Even though I fell mad at the world, I chose to forgive it. Even if I want to drown in my own pity, I chose not to. I do these things, so that I can live according to nature, so that I can become a better human being, so that I can become my best self, so that I can look back with clarity, so that days don't seem like one, so that I can remember what actions I took and what was it that I wanted to do. Don't let these things make you think that you are done on your journey, there is no end to the voyage you are on, until you are dead, deep in the mountain forests. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

Today I didn't eat properly, this might make me weak and unhealthy. I didn't stand up for my self, I was angry at the ignorance of others. I chose to be lazy today, I didn't pay closer attention to my wives feeling. I talked too much about nonsense today. These things are the doings of the evil you, the one you chose to control, the one that gives these ideas of foolishness, you must abandon this evil within your self, you must be the victor over your self, or do you want a life of misery, do you want to be fool a jester that others give money for making them think their lives are not so bad?   

4. **What duty remains undone?**

I have to learn German tomorrow, because I need to let it go from my mind. I procrastinated on this. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
