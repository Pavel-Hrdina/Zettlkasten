## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may be sick, you may feel weak, you may feel bad, you may meet people that are mean, angry, unhappy, ungrateful, and simple. You may feel the calling of nature, you may feel the need to shout out in anger from the bottom of your lunges. All of these things may prove difficult for you, but do not let them be your end, abandon them, let them be the way they should be, then you may find peace. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to learn for the OSP like a maniac, I recommend a four-hour session, you will do this, for it is your duty to your family and to your self. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my father, for helping me find the right way in life. 
	2. For my mother, for showing me how to love my self, through her own love.
	3. For my wife, for showing me, that it's ok to feel sad and unhappy sometimes.
	4. For being alive, this is a gift that I choose to cherish every single day. 
	5. For being born, I didn't choose this, but thanks to this, I am now alive.
	6. For being me, for all my emotions, and all my good and bad days, for all my obstacles, for trusting my self. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you are not enough, that all you do is not enough, that you must do better, that you are but one of many, that it's impossible for you to win over your self. Leave these thoughts behind, you must not succumb to them, give in to them, you must be a victor over your self, and over your weakness, that is your worry. I know you can find refuge with Buddha, so find it, no matter how hard nature treats you, there is a reason for it, that you can never understand, so leave the worry behind, and instead choose to take action, to leave all the worry behind.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how hard things might seem, no matter what loves you hit, no matter what you do, keep pushing your self, keep pushing your mind, keep pushing until you are dead, keep taking action, do not refuse it, do not be idle, take it, grasp your time into your hands and make it do your biding, not the other way around, you are going to die anyway, so why should you fear time, why should you fear anything, when your time comes, it comes, so find courage within your self, and leave fear behind, and do what you must! 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing unde your controll is your own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. So live like that, live as if you could die right now, live as if there was no tomorrow, and all the things must be done today. Things come, and go, so let them, but never you your self pass the chace for action.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
