## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may meet people that are mean, angry, agressive, unhappy and unkind, you may feel restless, you may feel like nothing is worth it, you may feel lazy, you may fail, you may feel overwhelemed, you may think that you can't do what is right. Well put all of these things behind you, because they are not the truth, you must keep on pushing, you must leave the people that are mean to you behind, you must choose to be peace and be happy with who you are.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I need to learn for OSP tests, I shall do this, and I shall be victorious. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my parents and how they are kind and supportive.
	2. For my family and it's good roots. 
	3. For my wife and her good heart.
	4. For being alive, for being me, for accepting, for trusting, for knowing. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you can't do anything right, that you are not good enough, that you have no energy, that people will hurt you, that you will fail, that you are too kind for this world. Now think about the truthlness of these thoughts. You must leave all of them in a place far away, in a desert, where there is nothing, you must put your worries there and once that's done, the desert will disapear, like your worries, then nothing can hurt you. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how hard might life seem, you must still push on to victory, you must sitill choose to find greatness even in the darkestes hour, you must choose curage, even when face with darkness. Never give up, only then you have failed your self, giving up, is the same as choosing not to act, and that you must never allow, for then you will lose controll over your self and your judgment and that is the only thing you can controll.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing that is within my controll is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and nothing else is. So use your judgment to make good things happen, to be peace and to be happy.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
