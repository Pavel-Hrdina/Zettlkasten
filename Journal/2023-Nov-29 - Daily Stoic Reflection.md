## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You are likely to meet sad, mad, ugly, crazy, mean people, you a likely to be cold, sad, mad, suffering and in pain. Furthermore, you are also likely to be lazy and unproductive. All of these things, you must choose to accept in your mind, you must choose to let them be the way they are, not the way you want them to be accept them and love them so. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	-  Today, you must choose to learn for the OSP tests, you must choose to learn for this test.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, my wife, my sister, books, being alive, being me, being nothing, knowing, letting go, nature, snow, my head, being resilient. For all of these things, I chose to be grateful. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You might be worried that you are sick, that you are nothing, that you can't do this and that, that you have no purpose, that you cannot help the suffering, that you cannot help your self to stop suffering, that you are starting to become lazy again, that you have no energy. All of these things, think, are they real? Are these things outside your control, outside your mind? If yes, then let them be, if no them let go off them, let them be the way they are, but don't let them affect you, don't let them put you down.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You might be thinking; "I can't do this", you might be thinking: "This is too much for me". But how are these thoughts of any help to you, how are they going to make you feel any better, how will they help you achieve good? Well they aren't. So what do I do with them? Just let them go, let them be the way they are, let them exist in the infinity of the universe, let them come and go as they are, do not be discouraged by a bad day, you must push thought difficulty with the correct judgments and then you will be unhurtable unteachable, none shall strike you down, you will be victories over your self.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only things within my control is my own [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md). So now, like every day, tell your self: "How can I use my judgment to do good?", "How can I help people and my self?". And then you may find, the true meaning of life.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

I did all that I had to, even though I am ill. I did this, so that I could say that my body might talk, but my mind won't listen to its nonesense.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

I haven't bean compassionete today. This was coused by my ilness and my state of mind and being.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

I done all that I had to do today.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
