## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I might be cold, I might get wet in the rain and I might be hungry, but I chose to remember, that these things cannot hurt me, if I don't choose for them to hurt me, they can't break me, they can't make me and I will be victorious over them. I might start to lose my trust in my self. I might meet the most disgusting, ugly, mean, angry, jealous and whatnot people. Not only that, but I chose to accept all of them, I chose to accept them with an open mind, love and open hands, without violence, without anger I shall let them glide against me, without touching me, without hurting, I will become undefeatable.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to finish what I set to do yesterday. I chose to do it, if I become tired, even if I become unwilling, I chose to do it.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my parents, that them for who I am today, my sister, my wife, my hobbies, my dreams, being alive, being me, having food on the table, having love around me, being warm, being my self, being, knowing the truth and much more I chose to be grateful for. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I don't have enough time, that I will fail, that I won't have enough time with my teacher and my mentors, that I will never be enough. Now think about the realness of your worries and then let them go, let them leave your mind like dying fire extinguishes itself.  
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You are the luckiest bastard I have ever met, "why?", you might be asking, is it because you were born right, is it because luck seemingly finds you everywhere. No, it is because you are bringing luck to your self, by working hard, by thinking deep and by thinking hard. You should thank your self. "What for?", you might be asking, the answer? My friend, it is simple, you believe in your self, and you have never given up on your self. So go and let your self fail again, again, again and again until you win, because a winner is not made overnight and without fail, there is no victory. You are still young so let your self make mistakes, let your self fail, it's ok. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], that is what actions I chose to take, how I chose. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today I was compassionate to all people, even my self, I did not let my self fail me. I did this because only a man that is loving and understands that he lives with other human beings, not only him self, will be rewarded and shall gain back what he has sowed. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

Today I made the mistake of not visiting my ill wife. I chose to do this in order to protect her and my self, for she is ill and even though I miss her very much, it cannot be helped, for she needs to heal, and yet I feel like it was wrong of me to not visit her and give her at least a kiss. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

Today I did not visit my grandpa, to copy the photos as I have promised. I have completely forgotten. Tomorrow I shall do this on my way home from work. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
