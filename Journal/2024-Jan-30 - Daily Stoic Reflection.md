## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_
### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may encounter people that are mean, violent, weird, and ungrateful. You may be laughed at, you may be lazy, you may think too much, you may feel bad about your self, and others. You may be cold, and you may be sick. Furthermore, you must choose to push on past your limits, and never give up, never give in to those, who think that they can push you down, that they can win over you, the victor laughs last. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, once again, you need to learn for the testing, like a wild beast, you shall push on to victory, without hesitation, without worry, without fear, and then you will win. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my parents, and that they take their time to listen to me, and even tell me the truth.
	2. For ancestors, and their way of life.
	3. For who I am, and for who I have been born.
	4. For being born, and existing.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may worry, that you will fail, you may worry, that you will be lazy, that you will be hated, that you will feel anxiety, that you don't have enough time, for what you want, and need. Well think about these worries, what happens, if you fail? What happens then? Nothing, you will just try again, "And what if I fail again?", you may say. Nobody will laugh at you, nobody will think less of you for it, you will just try again.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter what you might believe will happen, no matter how bad might things seem, remember that power is within, not outside from you, if you are searching for strength, you may find it in nature. You may find your self thinking week thoughs, well banish them, what will they give you, how will they benefit you? They won't so leave them, don't look back at them, and then do what is right.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- You controll your own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], your own mind, your self, and you decisions, you controll what you will eat, you controll who to trust, you controll what your reaction is.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
