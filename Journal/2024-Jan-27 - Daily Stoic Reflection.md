## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, people may be mean to you, they may be angry at you, they may be unhappy with you, they may hate you. You may want to be lazy, and you may not feel good. You may want to hate others, and you may be slow, you may regret many things, and you may be unable to speak.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I must learn, I must do this, and I will do this. I choose to do it with gratitude, and without a complained. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my wife, for my parents, for my sister, for being alive, for being me, for being happy, for trusting in my self, for life.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You are worried by all sorts of things, I know, from time, to death. All of these things are out of your control, so see what will they bring you, if they are truthful, imagine the worst thing that might happen, if they were to come alive, and you will see, that nothing will be out of the ordinary. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how dark might things seem to you, you must choose to push on, you must choose to win over your self, over your weekness, you must choose to do the things, that have to be done, no matter how hard they might seem, you will win over your self. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- You can controll your [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], so choose to do the thing that is right, choose to do the thing, that must be done, and then do it, without fail, the way you trusted your self to do it.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

	You did all your duties.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

	You were too pushy.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

	You did all the things that you set out to do today.

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

	Tomorrow, I will push my self harder.

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
