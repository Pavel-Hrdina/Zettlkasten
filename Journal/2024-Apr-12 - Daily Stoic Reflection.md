## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, I may find my self distracted, sick, being hated, being stressed, yet I must choose to push forward, let these difficulties be the way they are, for they are not in my control. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I need to see the truth about life and my self. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. I choose to be grateful for my self, being alive, my wife, my parents, love, trust, peace, understanding, peace and happiness, emotions and love.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- That I have no time.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Think, what is the difference, between today, and tomorrow? I know this question has been bugging you a long time now, yet you still can't find the answer to it, why? Is it that today, is the same a tomorrow in the mind, or is it that tomorrow is worth striving for, because one must choose to live every moment, like it was the last. Why live every moment, as if it was my last? Well, let's say that you could die today, that is entirely possible, the perception of time would change for you, you will start to feel as if nothing but the present matter, you would abandon what is not important, but why should you wait for that moment to come, why should you wait for death to find you? Why not embrace death with courage and say: "I shall live with you from now on, I will not let my self serve you and when the time comes to leave this world, I will not resist you, for you are not my enemy but my redemption.". So live every moment, as if it was your last, because you never know if you live until tomorrow, without looking at the past or the future, but instead living at the moment, that you have been given to experience by your destiny.  
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- My [[Control Over Judgment|Judgement]] is under my control. My body is under my control. I am under my control. Nothing else is under my control. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
