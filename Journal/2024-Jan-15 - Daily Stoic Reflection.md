## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may meet people that are mean, angry, ungrateful, hateful and unhappy. You may feel lost, you may feel that something's wrong, you may feel like you have no time, you may feel that you can't do what is right. All of these things, you must think about, as if they were cold, or as if they were a hurricane. You can choose to wear more jackets to protect your self from cold, so then you can choose to armor your self from these things, you must choose to let them be the way they are, because they are natural, and they are here to stay, you cannot change them, you cannot control them, you can only hope, that they will go away. So accept them with grace, and then you will be peace; no amount of worry will make things the way you need them to be.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, once again, you need to learn for the testing, nothing is more important, so even if you think it is, leave it and do it only after you have made preparations for the testing.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. I choose to be grateful for my parents and their trust.
	2. For my wife and her kindness, even if she is feeling bad.
	3. For being alive, for being me, for my sister, for being born, for warmth, for cold, for trees, for nature, for being young, for having warm food every day, for my mentors.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that what you are doing is wrong, that the path you are on is too easy, that what you thing is right is not, that you will fail, that you are but a shadow of your self, that you must be fast, even when nature tells you to slow down. Now think about every one of these things, what do they give you in return for making you feel bad, what do they make you belive? They make me belive that I am facing great problems. That is not true is it, so take the fear, take the worry, and put it in a place, a place as empty as the desert and put it there, then let the place slowly go away as you watch all the worries turn into nothingness. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how hard you think you have it, think about your wife, think about people that have endured hardships far greater than you, and then think: ,,Are my problems really that great and big?", and ,,Is there trully nothing I can do to solve these problems?".
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], and nothing else is fully under my control. So then choose to take action, it is the only thing you can do, so do it, and don't think about anything else, you have choosen to control you mind, and so it shall be.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
