### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You are likely to meet people who are mean, sad, angry, hurtful and spiteful, you may be cold, you may be lazy, you may be unhappy, you may be inpatient, you may be bored, and many other things might come your way. No matter what happens, you must remain loving, you must choose love over violence and hate, you must choose to love your self and others, because the world needs it, the people need it. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- You need to learn for all of my tests. You must choose to do so, you must choose to net let all the things pile up on you. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For parents, for sister, for being alive, for my wife, for having food every day, for being warm, for being me, for being resilient, for love, for peace, for book. You chose to be grateful for all of these things, and then be grateful for all the good that comes your way though the day. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You might be worried that you are weak, that you are a nobody, that you cannot do anything right, that you are a nobody. Now think: "How real are these worries? How helpful are they?". They are but an imaginary creation of the mind, and they are not helpful at all, so let go of them, abandon them, leave them be with their own fate.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You might be starting to believe all the crap people say, all the ugly, suffering words of the unhappy that want to harm you, but do not be mad at them for being this way, forgive them for their ignorance. These things are only meant to hurt, so do not let them touch your heart, do not let them hurt you. You must choose to be like rock, you must choose to be like a hard metal, unbreakable, while peacefully resisting any attacks from the suffering.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only things under my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgement]] and nothing else is. Thus, you must choose to use it for good, for love, to reduce the suffering without creating your own. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.


1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events

How I see them in the near future?

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus
