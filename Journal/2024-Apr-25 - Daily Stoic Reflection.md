## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, I am likely to encounter things that I have not prepared for thourly, I am likely to win, I am likely to face my self once again in a attempt to see what cannot be seen, in a attempt to once again challange my self and thus I shall conquer my fears and I shall attempt the impossible once again.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I need to calm my self, I need to have a crystal clear mind, like no one else. I need to be grateful, and never get arrogant.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. I choose to be grateful for my wife, for my father, for my opportunities, for my life and for the people, I am grateful for love, life, democracy, understanding, peace, and Buddhisms for saving me.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- That I may fail, that I know nothing.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how dark things look, you must always choose to see the light, how many times have we talked about this, and yet you still don't understand, and yet you still want things to be different. Choose to see the world as it is, not as it should be in your mind, let it be imperfect, let all things be in their natural state, as they should be. And so, don't force your ideas onto things that cannot be forced., let things be the way they are, for as long as you are alive, you cannot change them.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- My [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is under my control, what I do, how I act, how I react to my self, those things are under my control. The outcome of testing, my death, earth, nature, man, life, those things are not under my control.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
