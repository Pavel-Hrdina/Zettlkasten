## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_
^193c83
### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may feel lazy, you may feel bored, you may feel sick, your head might hurt, and you might feel lazy, as if you don't want to do anything, but I believe in you, you can do it, you can do what has to be done, and what is right, the things that are essential. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I shall learn for the testing, that is what you have to do 1st and foremost, I would also like you to discard all your fears from your mind, so do that as well. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my wife, my parents, who I am, being born, being me, being at peace, feeling, the weather, the need to be better, the internet, the people around me.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- The world frightens you, the future makes you sick, and death makes you run. You feel as if there was no hope, as if you are too dumb to do anything right, as if you had no place amongst humans. To think this way is a sing of a coward, so banish these thought, and think, on why would you think like that, what is there to fear, not even death is something that you should fear, because it can't hurt you, it can't do anything to you, so abandon it, let it be the way it should, and then be at peace that you can die without fear. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Things might seem shiny, I know that very well, but why don't you, instead of letting your fears taking over who you are, abandon those thought, for fear is a mind-killer, I must not fear, fear is a little death that brings nothing but failure, I will face my fear, and I will let it pass though me, I will let it go, and as I watch it disappear, I will turn my inner eye to the path I must follow, when the fear is gone, only I will remain.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- My [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is under my control, I choose to see it as my self, I choose to see it as reality, what I choose to do, is what will happen, and so I will take action, and I will not be obliterated without a fight, but then, if I fail, I shall know, that it was not in my power to win, for I have done, what my inner Buddha has guided me to do, and so it was to be that way, and so I will not lament, but instead rejoice, that I had the opportunity, and that I had taken it.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
