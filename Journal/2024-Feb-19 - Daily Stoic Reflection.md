## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- The traffic, the people, ignorance, laziness, meanness, emotions, weather, tiredness.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- You choose to learn for the testing when you come home today.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. My mother, my father, my loved ones, my wife, my ancestors, being alive, being free, being me, trust, happiness, love, emotions, understanding, difficulty, challenges, nature, truth, democracy.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- That you will fail, that you are lazy, that you are not doing enough, that you could be doing more, that you could be better, that you are loosing over your self, that you are too slow.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Look at your self, what do you see, do you see a man, do you see a child, do you see someone you can respect? Stop thinking that you are lazy, you are NOT, so don't put your self down, don't waste time, by hating your self, and do what is right, and when you think to your self, I have lost, think instead: "I have done what I could, I have done my best, and now that I am at the end of the road, I know, that it was not in my power, to achieve victory, and so I shall lose with dignity.", remember a working man has to be resting, and a resting man needs to be working.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- My [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], my decisions, my mind, I, what I say, what I do, what I eat, these things are under my control. How tired I am, how well I have slept, what weather is it going to be today, how people treat me, how they react to me, these things are not under my controll.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
