## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You may encounter people who are mean, mad, angry, aggressive, unhappy and unkind, you may also be cold, in pain and feeling weird. All of these things may make your life a bit harder, but you must choose to accept them with love and grace, they are the way they are, so chose to accept them. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- You must choose to learn for the scio tests today. Yes, I know that you don't want to, but instead of complaining, just do it. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, my wife, sister and my family, being alive, being me, being happy, being warm, having food every day, having an education, having friends and having warmth. I chose to be grateful for all of these things.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You might be worried that you are nothing, but a dream, but an illusion, but one of many, only mediocre without any purpose just to live. You might also be worried that you are sick, sad, dumb and what not. These things are not real, they are just in your head, they are but illusions a plague on your mind trying to stangle you, trying to attack you from the shadows. So let these things be, let the worry leave your mind, let it be. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Even when you feel like you are about to give up, you must start to push agains your self, you must break your mind free from the worry, you must accept whatever is about to happen and then take action withou fear, without your mind being poisoned, with your heart at the right place, you mustn't give up, what is worse that you giving up, remember the light that you see at the end.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- Only thing within my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. Now that you once again realize this truth, you must use it to be good, loving and kind to all suffering beings, accept people for who they are, even the dark ones and you may find peace.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
