## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to encounter: cold weather, loneliness, being overwhelmed, lack of motivation, strong wind, pain, big storm and much more stuff that I can't even think of. I now chose to face these difficulties with calmness, peace and love, so that I can move forward and take action when needed, so that I don't freeze in place from having no idea what should be done.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to learn for tomorrow's test, then I can rest. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my mother, my sister, my father, my wife, the weather, being alive, being peace, having enough, knowing what is right, being me, books and much more that I can't event think of.   
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I can't do everything in time, that I have too little energy, that I can't do what I need to do, that I am losing my freedom. I now chose to let go of these worries with love and kindness   
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No problem is great enough to be worth worring about.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing that is under my control is my [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md) and how do I choose to use it, in order to develop my self further. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
