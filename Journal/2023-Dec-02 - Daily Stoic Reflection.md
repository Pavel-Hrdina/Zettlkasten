## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today you are likely to experince cold, lazyness, bordom, being unmotivated and having no will to do anything, you may also be tempted into anger and wrong doing, you may also feel like you don't want to do anything, like there is nothing you want to do, as if you just want to lay down and be at peace without any intervention, just being nothing like before and like after you. You must deal with these feelings withou pain, without suffering, you must chose to meditate on them, let them become peace, let them become one with your and then let them go, let the change be the way it is and adapt to it.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to fix the internet on my main computer.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, for my wife, for my sister, for being me, for being alive, for warmth, for food, for the things I have and the things I chose to let go of, education, peace, freedom and kindness. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I can't do anything right, that I can't finish what I set to do, that I can't do the things right. That I am nothing. You now must chose to let go of these worries, you cannot change what is to come anyway,  
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter what you are facing, that whitch you can't change is naturall and thus is none of your concern and even if you shall die by hunger, that is out of your controll, it is how nature has desided it to be, so let it be so.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing withing my controll is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. If this is the only thing you can controll, be botherd only by things you have not chosen to do. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today, you have been kind to your self and other, even when faced with anger and meaness, you have done all of your duties and you have allowed your self to relax a bit, you haven't complained and you overcame feelings of worthlessness, you have spend time with your wife and your loved ones, you have accepter the weather and your own mistakes, you have accepted your human nature and you have accepter your self. You have done these things, because they are naturall, they are simple, yet important, you don't have to complicate things, you don't have to make things difficult in order to get things done, you just need to be calm, patient and pressent, then the rest will follow.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

Today, you haven't done much of a progress, even though nature had other plans, you should have found a way to do the things that were needed, even if you faced a difficulty that was not so easy to get over. You should have also let your self do nothing today, just lie in bed watching your self and thoughts come and go, come and go, resting in peace, not thinking, not trying just being, living in the pressent, letting go of worry and all the cluster on your mind, well even if you dind't do this today, you shall do it tomorrow. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

You didn't learn for the test, otherwise you did all the things that you set out to do today. You dind't do it, because you chose not to, not because you were unable to. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
