## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You are likely to doubt your self, you are likely to be lazy, unfocused, unpressed and unkind, you may be cold, and you may feel bad, you may meet people who are mean unhappy, sick and arrogant. All of these things, you must choose to accept it for what they are, you mustn't give in to them, you mustn't let them drain you, put you down, make you feel bad or what is worse angry or even sad. You must instead choose to let them be the way they are, their nature is nor good not bad, so view them as such and natural and thus as the way they are. You don't complain about the wind, or about snow, or about the sun scorching your skin. Likewise, you do think this way, because these things are unchangeable they won't change no matter what you do, so think of these difficulties like that also. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- You must finish, what remains undone, you must go, and do the things that you have set out to do, without complained, banishing thoughts of monkey mind, letting go of worries about the future or the past, just doing it now, in the present moment, no matter what.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, for my wife, for my sister, for being alive, for having food every day, for being me,
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you will fail, that you are not enough, that you will lose your loved ones, that you cannot do anything right, that you are an idiot. These thoughts are but a poison in your mind, in your soul, they are not worth anything but a cure, they must be banished from your mind and soul, for they will make you sick, they will make you feel as if you were drowning, but instead of thinking how hard it is to get rid of them, be loving and think of them this way; One: "I shall love my self and every thought I have, no matter if good or bad." and two: "You shall now let go of your worry, let it flush out of your heart.".
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You may be thinking how hard you have it now, you may be thinking that you have it bad and all and that you don't deserver what you have and that thinking this is wrong, and it makes you ungrateful for the things you have. Now, how are you helping your self, if you think like this? You are only damaging your self and your soul, you must instead choose to think, when these thoughts come to mind, that you are no God, you are men, and if you are humaner than it's ok to have thought like these, but once they come, you let them go. You must choose to see the light at the end of the tunnel no matter how dim it may be, you must choose to try and reach it, even if it's impossibly far away, you must believe that it is possible.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing that is under my control is my own [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md). Nothing else is under my control, so I must use my judgment to do things that are good, to follow nature.


### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

I was kind to my self, I allowed my self to make mistakes, I let my self be at peace with who I am, I chose to accept my self, I chose to make disicions based on thought, not on impulls, I chose to become better, I chose to relax, I chose to be at peace whatever has come my way, I chose to let go of worry. I did all of these things, so that tomorrow, I can look at my self with peace and say, I can do this, I can become better, I am not an idiot, I chose to do these things for a better tomorrow.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

I chose to be angry, I chose to put my self down and be put down by others, I chose to devalue my self, I chose to sabotage my self. Why did I do these things? I should look deeper, what made me act this way? Maybe it was my past hurt, maybe it was my past self, maybe it was my passivity, but that does not matter. Tomorrow and for the rest of your life, do not let these things happen to you again, chose to be better.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

All did all the things tha I set out to do today.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
