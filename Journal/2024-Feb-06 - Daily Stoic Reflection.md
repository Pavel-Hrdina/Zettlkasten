## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_
^193c83
### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may feel like shit, people may be mean to you, you be stuck in a traffic jam, you may be scared, and you may have to deal with violence, criticism, and hatefulness. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I once again need to learn for the testing, I know that I am repeating my self, but it has to be done.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my wife, and her kindness.
	2. For my parents, for being me, for being alive, for trust, for understanding, for emotions, for people, for life.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- That I could die today, that I could lose those, who I love, that I will fail, that I am not good enough, that I am too emotional. If you were to die today, what would it change, yes, nothing, life would keep on going, only you wouldn't be a part of it. Think how clinging to loved once harms you, think how attachment makes you unhappy, think how hard it is for those who have money, and nothing else. And all the other things, well they are as worthy of sadness and anxiety as all the others, they have no value so let them go.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Even if things seem hard, even if you feel like dying, you must choose to push on, to conquer your fear, and your self, to push against your limits, and to emerge victorious.  
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- I can control my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]].

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
