> [!quote]  Epicurus
> “Meditate then, on all these things, and on those things which are related

> asleep or awake by imagined fears, but you will live like a god among 
> men. For a man who lives among immortal blessings is in no respect 
> like a mortal being.”

### The Gravestone Method

> [!quote]
> What do you want to be written on your tombstone? What about what your friends will say about you at your funeral. We are dying every day. Take it further thinks about what will people remember you for, think about what would you left behind, think about what will you pass on.

When I die, I want my tombstone to say: "Give me liberty or death.". The people should say that I was kind and that I helped them in life to overcome their challenges, and that I was the one who helped them at their lowest. I want to be remembered. When I die, I want my parents to already be dead, so they won't suffer my death. If I'd die right now, I would be remembered for my happiness, my feeling and my potential. 

## A VIEW FROM ABOVE

_This exercise is designed to reminded you about how small you really are, and how little importance most things have. In other words, to give you a sense of the bigger picture. It's quite simple, use your imagination to try and relate yourself to the whole world and beyond._

## MEDITATIONS ON THE IDEAL MAN

- Create a list of role models 
- Analyze what makes them ideal
