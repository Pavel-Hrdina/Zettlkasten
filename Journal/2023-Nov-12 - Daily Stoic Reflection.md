## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Toady I am likely to face my own self, negativity of others that is their hate, anger, envy, jealousy, meanness, idiocy, lack of compassion, lack of love, their suffering and their negativity. I am also likely to experience lack of time, energy and compassion, yet I chose love and kindness to all beings. I chose to not let these adversities move me to make bad [[Control Over Judgment|Judgments]], I chose to accept them without complaint and without pity for my self or others.   
1. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to learn for tomorrows exam. I chose to do this, and then I chose to read for at least 30 minutes thoroughly. 
2. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my mother, my father, my sister, my wife, the weather, the opportunities I have, the people I love, being alive, having food on the table every day, having warmth, having a place to sleep, my life lessons, knowing my worth, understanding that I have, books that I can read, things that I can do, things that I can see, the freedom I have and peace. I chose to be grateful for all of these things and many more, I chose to find love and peace in the smallest of accomplishments and in the smallest of wins. 
3. **What is worrying me?**
	- 
4. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- 
5. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
