## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Toady I am likely to face my own self, negativity of others that is their hate, anger, envy, jealousy, meanness, idiocy, lack of compassion, lack of love, their suffering and their negativity. I am also likely to experience lack of time, energy and compassion, yet I chose love and kindness to all beings. I chose to not let these adversities move me to make bad [[Control Over Judgment|Judgments]], I chose to accept them without complaint and without pity for my self or others.   
1. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to learn for tomorrows exam. I chose to do this, and then I chose to read for at least 30 minutes thoroughly. 
2. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my mother, my father, my sister, my wife, the weather, the opportunities I have, the people I love, being alive, having food on the table every day, having warmth, having a place to sleep, my life lessons, knowing my worth, understanding that I have, books that I can read, things that I can do, things that I can see, the freedom I have and peace. I chose to be grateful for all of these things and many more, I chose to find love and peace in the smallest of accomplishments and in the smallest of wins. 
3. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that there is not enough time for me, that I am lazy, that I am not enough, that I can't do what I set to do. Now I chose to let go of these worries as there is no logic behind them. Why would you think that you don't have enough time, you have to chose what is worth your time. So let go of these worries peacefully, leave them behind your self, behind in time leave them as if you were an hourglass and your worries were the sand falling thought slowly, but with peace and understanding. 
1. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter what problems you might think you have, all will be well, for you are still alive, you are not dead yet, you can still go on without worry, without tripping, without falling you wouldn't make no progress at all, you need to make mistakes, you need to fall. That is the nature of human struggle and if you can't accept it and learn from it, then you won't make it far, if you hide your self in a bubble that none can enter, then you have failed at life my friend. 
2. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing that is truly under my control is my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], that is what action I take, what I chose to do, what I chose is important for me. Now I chose to use my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] for good, for love and peace. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

I reacted calmly to people who were angry, who tested my resilience, who made me judge my own worth, who pushed my patience and my love for the humankind. I chose to accept them with open hands and open heart as the seashore chooses to accept the waves of the sea, no matter how big they get, no matter how much force they put on the shore, it remains calm, unfazed, it remains.   

2. **What did I do wrong?**

I was late to do all the things that I set to do, this way I made my day chaotic and without order, I got lost in my own mind and under the tasks and information that came my way. I chose this way, because I wanted to spend time with my wife, instead of giving my self order, and thus I succumb to temptation. I must choose more wisely tomorrow, I must let my laziness perish, I must let it die like a phoenix and rise from the ashes of my past anew.    

4. **What duty remains undone?**

I still didn't finish my tasks on my task list, even though they would only take a few moments to do. I chose to not do them for the sake of my family, that was my biggest priority today and I don't regret making this decision, but tomorrow I must push my self harder and achieve greatness. 
## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
