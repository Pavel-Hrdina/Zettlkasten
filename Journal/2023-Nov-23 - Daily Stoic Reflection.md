## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You might the worst of the worst human being, you might see violence, you might be cold, and you might be sick, you might even feel bad, you might be tempted and you might lose track. These things might happen to you today, but you mustn't reject them as being ugly or bad. Nothing is by nature good or bad, so look at these things and thing, why are they like this, and why should something like that be seen as good? 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to register for university acceptance exams. I chose to do this today.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I chose to be grateful for my parents, my sister, my wife, my friends, my opportunities, books, having food on the table every day, my mentors, my ancestors, being alive, being me, knowing what is essential, knowing when to make mistakes and when to be precise. I chose to be grateful for all of these things that I have been blessed with.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You might be worried that you are not enough, that you are an idiot, that you are too kind, that you are not enough, that you might lose the people you love. But think now, how real are these worries, what do they bring that, is good to you? What did they bring in terms of results? So lose these thoughts, and replace them with love and compassion. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how you might be feeling, what mood you have woken up with, what life do you think you have, that you have no energy, that you can't go anymore. Push your self harder, push your self smarter and see the light at the end, the Eden that awaits you for your work is there. The light that sometimes shines very bright, and other times is almost not visible, is there at all time, and it is up to you to chose to see it, or chose to ignore it and suffer.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within your control is your own [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md). With this newfound knowledge chose to use your judgment for action, to better your self and to better your life and the life of others and even if the path seems to be made of thorns full of pain and hard work, sometimes it's better to chose this path.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today, you did all the things that you had to do. You chose to do this in order to become a better human being. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

You let my emotions control you. This happened because you can't keep up anymore, you are about to burn out, take a day off. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

I did all the duty that had to be done.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
