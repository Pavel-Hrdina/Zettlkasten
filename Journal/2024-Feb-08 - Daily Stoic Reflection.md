## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_
^193c83
### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	-  You may find that people are mean to you, you may think bad thoughts, you will suffer, you may be paralyzed by fear. You may be tired, you may be weak, you will be stuck in a traffic jam, you will have to be strong, you must work had. All of these things may come your way, you must not be broken by them, you must face them, you must work harder than ever, you must choose to win.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you must do, what is your duty to your self, you must choose to work, you must choose to be strong, and then you will win.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my wife, and her never-ending love.
	2. For my parents, and their support.
	3. For my family and their love, and kindness.
	4. For being alive, for being born, for being me, for loved ones. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- Worry, why do you fear, what is there to fear, nothing, so abandon all of your fears, I know that these things, like failure bother you very much, but instead of fear, feel your self, and have not, let it come to a place as empty as the desert, let the fear sink deep into the sand, and then turn the sand into a void, and suddenly, your fear has fallen in, so let it fall until it leaves your mind, and soul.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You may start to believe, you may start to think, that the light that you seem, is no more, that it's not where it has always been, that it's somewhere, where you can't find it, somewhere deep within, believe me it's there, where you have put it, it's there, but you must choose to see it, so do, and go for it, don't fear loss, don't fear pain, don't fear loneliness, because they can hurt you, if they don't exist.
1. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- You can controll onlly your own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], so do that, and take action.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

	Today, you did your best, I know it is hard for you, but you did what you could, you even went to train. You displayed curage, by saing what you belive in.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

	Today, you didn't do the things that were your duty, for the lack of energy you had.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

	Today, you didn't learn for the OSP testing, well, you will just have to work extra hard on the weekend.

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

	Tomorrow, I will do my best, to do my duty without fail.

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
