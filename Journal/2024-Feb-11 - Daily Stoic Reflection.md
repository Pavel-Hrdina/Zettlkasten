## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_
### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may feel the need to be lazy, to do nothing, and just be lazy, the way you want to be. You may feel the need to shout out into the world, like a beast that hurt itself, like some kind of animal, that has yet to lose its anger, you may feel, as if you cannot win over your self, like there is nothing that can be done to win. You may have to face your self, and your own fears.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I need to win over my self, I have to conquer my self, and win.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my wife, for my mother, for my father, for my sister, for being alive, for my parents, for trust of all, for knowing who I am, for loving my self.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried, that you may lose, that you may fail your self, that you may not be able to win over who you are. But instead of thinking like that, think instead: "I will win, I will be the best, I can do it when I set my mind to it.", you must not push your self down, and at the first sight of despair, you must instead choose to see the truth, and that victory, is but a matter of time.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter what you might be going through, you must choose to see past the mistakes you have made, past the things that have been bothering you, see past the pain of the past, see past your own shadow and your ego, and do what has to be done, and if you have done what was in your power, than you can be at peace, for there is nothing more that can be done, and you shall do it, the things that must be done.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- You can control your own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], and your own choice, nothing else is fully under your control, so choose to do it, choose to do what has to be done, choose to be the victor over your self, and your own weakness, I know you can do it, I know you can win, I know you can push past your limits.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

	Today, you relaxed, and worked a bit as well, you gave time to your wife.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

	You didn't learn for the OSP for as long as you could.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

	You didn't do the view from the above.

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

	Tomorrow, you will do all your duties. 

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
