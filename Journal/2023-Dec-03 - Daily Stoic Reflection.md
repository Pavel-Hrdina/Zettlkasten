## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You may meet people that are mean and generally bad, you may be cold, sad, unhappy, feeling worthless, feeling bad and mad, you may feel disorganized and generally wrong. All of these things are out of your control, you cannot change them, you cannot control them, so don't be poisoned by them, let these things be the way they are, the way they should be.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to do one osp test and go thought all the types of exercises in the tests. I shall do so today. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my mother, for my father, for my sister, for being alive, for being me, for having warm food every day, for warmth, for understanding of life, for knowledge, for wisdom, for diligence, for kindness. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You might be worried, that you are not doing what you should be doing, you might be worried about the future and the past. Now remember, how much did those worries give you, how much happier did they make you? You see that they didn't do anything for you, so let them go.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Become diligent, become unbreakable, become unbeatable, become feared, never back down, never give up, never let anybody put you down, never let people be mean or angry at you. You must put your self in the first place, even if it costs you relationships, even if it makes you suffer in the short term. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my own judgment and nothing else is. So if you know this, chose to use it for your advantage, chose to do things that need to be done today and not tomorrow.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
