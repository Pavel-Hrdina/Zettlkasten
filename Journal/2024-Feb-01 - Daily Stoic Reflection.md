## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_
### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may find, that people will be mean to, people may be ugly, unkind, mean, and laugh at you. You may be stuck in a traffic jam, you may be bored, you may see suffering, you may feel pain, you may cough like hell, and you may be cold. Remember, none of these things shall break you, none of these things shall put you down, you will be victorious!
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to learn for the testing, you must do this today, you must choose to push your self to you limits, you must choose to be great, you must feel peace before your self, so do what must be done!
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my parents, for my wife, for both of their love, and peace.
	2. For being alive, and for being me.
	3. For my ancestors.
	4. For trust.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you have no time, that you can't do what must be done, that you can't do the things that you want, that you don't have enough time. That you will fail. But don't worry about these things, I know you are doing your best, I know you are doing what you can do to be the best.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Things might be hard for you to know, but that is how you know, that you are on the right path, as one wise man said: "If it's easy, you are on the wrong path.". So rejoice, that it's hard, rejoice in the small successes that you have, every day, that you do what must be done, rejoice, and celebrate, for another day, you have between your own ego, and your own shadow. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing that is within my controll, is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], you mind is under your controll, your choise of actions is under your controll, what you say is under your controll. These things are under your controll, so use them, and then rejoice in them, let them be your guiding light.
### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
