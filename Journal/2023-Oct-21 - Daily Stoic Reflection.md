## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to be lazy, mean people, be lonely, be bored, be challenged. If any of these adversities' meat me I will face them head on and will not be broken by them, instead I will fight against them. I will not be broken by myself or others, no! I must push against the waves of uncertainty and make create for my self what I want for others.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I must go for a walk and read the book, then I must do the practice test. I will do these things that I must do, I promise my self this, for I cannot break a promise to my self.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my parents, my wife, being alive, being healthy being me, having enough, having food to eat, having warmth, peace, nice weather, and many more I am grateful for. All of this may seem like it's normal, but nothing should not be taken for granted. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that we might lose our freedom, that my voice is weak, that I dumb and too slim. These things worry me.  
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- When you feel your self about to give up, remember how many days you have left, how bad you will feel if you give in, remember how will others react if you give up, you must push thought weakness. You are living for your self, every day you push against you and no one else. You are your only enemy, you are your only obstacle like Sisyphus pushing the boulder up the hill, you are pushing you are pushing against your self and no matter how many times the bolder falls you must push it up again.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- My own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is under my control. I must remember that this is the hardest thing that I will ever have to gain mastery over. I can use my judgment to influence the outcomes of things that I can't control, but I will still be uncertain about the outcome, as it is impossible for me to know if my judgments were correct. Even so, If I made the judgment my self, I have won. I cannot control anything besides my judgment and what I chose to do.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

**Today's Events:**

Today many things happened, I approached all things calmly and with love and appreciation. I didn't fell like sleep walking, even thought I felt tired, the things that had to be done, I did. Even thought I didn't do some things, I didn't do them to spent time with my loved ones. We went on a trip today and I loved it a lot, we should go again tomorrow, it was a lot of fun. Today I also decided that I will get a motorcycle license and make enough money to buy a motorcycle. 

**How I see them in the near future?** 

These events will help me to regain my strength for the following week, and I will need it a lot. I am really worried that I will fail my self again. I failed me so many times. Now I hear you say how pitiful you are as you are drowning in your own sorrow. Stand up! Fight for your self and for the human race. Fight so the next generations can live as we did. Fight so that we regain harmony with nature as it was many moons ago. Do not let your pity prevent the survival of men. Do not let the poison that was set on this earth make you weak, you must fight through this and regain your dignity.

**How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?:**

These events will be viewed as joyful by the loved ones and if anybody else hears of them, he won't think much of them, they were normal day events and nothing special really happened. 

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
