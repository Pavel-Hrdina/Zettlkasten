## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You may be tired, but you are not dead yet, you may feel sad, but you are not dead yet, you may meet people who are mean, arrogant, aggressive, unpredictable, unhappy and suffering, you may feel like giving up. You must choose to push on, to never give up, to never back down, to choose to do what you believe is right, what you believe should be done and is within your control, so push on, don't be discouraged, do what you believe in.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	-  Today I need to work on the presentation. I shall do this, and I will do this, I choose to do this.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, for my sister, for my family, for my wife, for being alive, for being me, for food every day, for warmth, for understanding, for letting go, for knowing my worth, for pushing on, for the kind people, for the motivators.  
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I am lazy, that I don't deserve what I have, that I might give up, that I can't do what I set out to do, I am worried that I can't make a change, that I am that guy without confidence, that can't stand up for him self. You must choose to let go of these worries, what do they do for you, how do they help you become your best self? They don't, so let go of them, become the best you can be, never let anyone hurt you, never be put down. So banish these thoughts and push on.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how dark things might seem, you must still choose to push on, you must continue on your journey, you must choose to accept who you are and your nature, no matter how hard you try you can't change these things, the only thing you can do, is try more than is your best choose to never give up, never back down, just behind the corner, there might be gold hiding, you must choose to believe this, you must choose to look at the stars at night and think: ,,We will be the conquerors of stars". You must dream so big, that it seem impossible, but you can do it, you can achive your dreams. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and nothing else is, it is the only thing under my control. Choose to use your judgment to do good and live according to nature, do not succumb to your temptations, don't let your self make judgments without deciding that they are the right path. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today, you have chosen to face your fears, you have choosen to conquer your self to never let you become a coward, even though this day might feel like one of the wors days this year, one of the days you failed what you could, you still must understand, that one day out of many is nothing, you only live a short while, you can do only so much in your life and thing are out of your controll, so don't live your life in fear of death, of the if, live, as if you could die tomorrow, as if you could die now, so belive in your self, what else can you do, what else is left to do, but this if you could die now, what do you have to lose, everyone is going to die anyway so why cling to the wordly things that are fake anyway, the only truth is in nature and in nothing else, so don't force your self to the standars of the fake and do what you belive is right. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

You have broken a promise to your self today twice, you were overwhelmed with emotions, you couldn't do what was right at that moment, you are getting tired, even though it feels like you don't do anything but relax. But don't ever think about giving up, you must choose to push on, to never give up, that's the only thing you can do, no matter what cards you were dealt, no matter how dumb you may be, no matter how shitty you might fell, you must do your duty, you must choose to be kind, loving and happy. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

Today, you did all the things that you set out do to, congratulations.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
