### Evening

> [!quote]  Epicurus
> “Meditate then, on all these things, and on those things which are related 
> to them, both day and night, and both alone and with like-minded 
> companions. For if you will do this, you will never be disturbed while 
> asleep or awake by imagined fears, but you will live like a god among 
> men. For a man who lives among immortal blessings is in no respect 
> like a mortal being.”

### The Gravestone Method

> [!quote]

## A VIEW FROM ABOVE

_This exercise is designed to reminded you about how small you really are, and how little importance most things have. In other words, to give you a sense of the bigger picture. It's quite simple, use your imagination to try and relate yourself to the whole world and beyond._

When I look at my self from the above, I see but one of many, but one of millions, all of whom have problems, some struggle to survive til the next day, as they have nothing to eat, some struggle with their boss being an idiot, but all have problems. So why should I, but one of many struggle the same, be the same as all of them, them who try to be different and make things complicated, those who try to mold life to who they are, instead of molding themselves to life. The farther I see my self from, the more I realize how title I matter, how little humanity matters, even if all perish, nothing will change in the universe, stars will be born, and stars will be destroyed until the end of times. 

## MEDITATIONS ON THE IDEAL MAN

- Create a list of role models 
- Analyze what makes them ideal
