## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may meet people that are mean, arrogant, angry, disrespectful, unkind, unloving, unhappy, ungrateful, you may be cold, and you may feel sorrow, you may also be lazy, and you may feel like you don't want to do anything, and you may be temped to do nothing. Instead, choose to do better, choose to do more, choose to become a better human being and choose to do things that you thought were impossible for you, you must overcome your own shadow and then you may be great.  
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to go to the gym and do your best. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I choose to be grateful for my parents, my wife, my sister, for being alive, for being me, for doing my best, for knowing when to be done, for books, for life, for my luck, for finding balance, for knowing what's essential and what is worth it.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you are not enough, that you can't do things that you want to do, that you can't learn anything, that you're dumb, that you can't do this. But instead of letting these thoughts creep in your mind and poison you, you must choose to banish them by thinking like this; One: ,,I can do what I set out to do, if I have the willl to do it.''; Two:  ,,It's ok to make worong desicions, if you have choosen to do them''; Three: ,,I will never give up, for if I would die tomorrow, I wouldn't die in peace.''. Keep all of these thoughts at hand, in your mind and deep under your skin, let them become a part of you and let them sink peacefully into your soul.
1. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how dark things might seem, keep pushing on, never give up, allways search for the light at the end of the tunnel, always choose to be better always choose to be gratefull for what you have, always choose to look at your problems as if you should die tomorrow, never let your self be passive or ignorant of life, never let anyone tell you, that you can't do something, even if you belive you can, if you do, then do it.
2. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing that is within my controll is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. With this understanding, choose to use it for your own peace of mind, to be peacefull and to be calm. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
