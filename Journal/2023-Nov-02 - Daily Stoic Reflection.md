## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- I am likely to meet very difficult people, I am likely to feel stressed, I am likely to procrastinate, I am likely to be cold, I am likely to be sad, I am likely to feel bad, I am likely to suffer, I am likely to experience pain and match more. I chose to accept these things with loving kindness and to forgive my self.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I chose to do the tasks I have from yesterday.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my family, my family, my life, being alive, having emotions, having a heart, being me, being resilient, being human, the weather, my home, my country. I chose to be grateful for all of these things, all the other good things that I might encounter today.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I can't learn in time what I want to learn. I am worried that I might get into a fight today. I am worried that my anger is beyond my control. I am worried that I will be a good for nothing. I am worried that I might lose the people I love. Now I chose to accept these things with love and grace, letting go of them worries, like a bird that lets the wind guide his path. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Yes, I know you feel like shit today, perhaps you might be thinking to your self, what have I done to suffer so match. Think instead that you are alive, that you have food every day, that you wake up warm, that you are healthy, so do not pity your self for someone being mean to you, someone talking shit, let go of the anger you have towards these people, leave their words in the past and focus on the present. Use the love you have for others and your self to heal the suffering, and all will be well.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- My [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is the only thing under my control, the only real thing I have control over, now I chose to use my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] for good.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today I remained calm in the face of great adversity created by others and my mind, this was challenging for me to endure, so I did to become a better human being, and then I was kind to those who wronged me with poison and this has made them lose their control over me completely. Today I also finished tasks, that I have been putting off for some time, this has helped me to reduce the cluster my mind was carrying and that was making me stressed, I chose to do this in order to reduce the burdens I have on me and to make time for other tasks in the future. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

I have made jokes that I hid my true emotions with, thus avoiding confronting my self when I needed it, this I did to avoid being judged by others and that was a mistake that I must not make again tomorrow. Today I did not give enough time to my wife, even when she had time for me and I for her, I chose to do other things, this I did because there were things that I couldn't put off any longer. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

I have yet to complete tasks that are of the utmost importance, but not today, they will be done tomorrow, once I get home, they are not yet done because I chose to have balance in my life. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
