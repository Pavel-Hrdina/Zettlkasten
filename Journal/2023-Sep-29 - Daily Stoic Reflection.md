## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

5. How can I decatastrophize today's problems?
	1. - You are thinking that today, you couldn't change anything, but it's ok, even the things that seem so simple are the most complex, it is simplicity that is the hardest to execute, you might be thinking that you have no time left on this earth, but you are still here, you still have a part to play, so let go of fears, there is no need for them. They only block you from seeing the truth before you, so let go of them, you will die when your time comes anyway, this time might be tomorrow, or in 50 year, but it will come once your job in this life is done. 
6. What is within my control and what is not
	1. - My [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md) **is under my control**
	2. - What I do **is under my control**

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. What did I do well today?

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | -----------------------|

| - I refined my stoic journal | - To get peace |
| - I finished all my tasks | - To be at peace |


## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
