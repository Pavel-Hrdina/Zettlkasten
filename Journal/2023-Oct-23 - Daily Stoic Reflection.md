## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to face cold on the road and people that want to kill me on it. I am also likely to encounter mean people and dump people. I chose to face these challenges with calm and clear mind and I won't let them put me down or harm me.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, the most important thing is, to pick books for maturita. I chose to do this today in Excel.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my mother, my wife, my sister, being alive, my ancestors, my country, peace, simplicity, adversity, cold, warm, food. I am grateful for all of these things and many more. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I will face on my motorcycle again. I am worried because of vivid nightmares. I am worried that I will grieve today. All of these things are worrying me now, and so I chose to let go of them.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- When the hour seems dark and all seems lost, you have to chose to find all of your remaining strength and use it. As long as you're breathing and the heart is pumping blood into your veins, you must push forwards until there is nothing but darkness or victory. I know that this sounds violent, but no violence is ever the answer. So do not commit verbal or physical violence on anybody.    
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing under my control is my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. I choose to use the control I have over my judgment to try and make life better for everyone. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today I was careful when riding my motorcycle, I was happy thought out the day, I was articulate and peaceful, and I did what I had to do no mater what. I did these things to improve my self and others.   

2. **What did I do wrong?**

I lost control of my self and my judgment for a moment today. I did this out of rage and tiredness. Furthermore, I must avoid this tomorrow. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

Today I didn't pick the maturita books. I didn't do it because there was no time. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
