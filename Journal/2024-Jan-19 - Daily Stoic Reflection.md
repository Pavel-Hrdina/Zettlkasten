## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may meet people that are mean, angry, aggressive, unhappy, unkind and mean, you may feel like shit, and you may have to face your fear. You may have no time and you may feel lazy.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, once again, you need to learn for the OSP testing, this is of the utmost importance, today, learn for at least 2 hours. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my loving wife
	2. For my parents
	3. For my family
	4. For being born.
	5. For being me
	6. For books
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you can't do anything right, that you can't do what you belive is the right way, that you are weak, that you are sick, that you will lose what you have, that you can't finish what you have started, that you can't do what you need to do.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You must choose to start beliving in your self. You must stop letting others put you down, degrade you, humiliate you, you must show them your other cheek, and offer the kindness, and if they can't accept it, leave. You are on the right path, I know you can see the light at the end off the tunnel, you know it's there, so go for it, run for it, don't let it be only a dream, let it be a reality, make the dreams you have come true, shape your destiny, like you would your self thought action. Don't worry about the things you can't controll, leave them be, instead choose to focus on what you can.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	-  The only thing that is wihtin my own controll is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], so choose to use it to be who you were born to be in the first place.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

	

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
