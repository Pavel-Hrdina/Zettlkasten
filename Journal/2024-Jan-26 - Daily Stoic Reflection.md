## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- I may meet people that are unkind, unhappy, unloving, sad, and mean. I could feel lazy, and all sorts of emotions. Furthermore, I could be stuck in a traffic jam, I could be stressed, I could die, I could get hurt. To all of these difficulties, you are going to react calmly and with serenity, and peace. I will not use violence, to overcome these difficulties, I will not feel sorrow, for those who may wrong me, and I will not be affected by their words. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I need to evaluate what has to be done when I come home, I shall do the view from the above reflection, that will help me estimate what has to be done, and what will happen, if I fail, so that I don't feel stressed about it. I also need to create a time plan.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For having food every day, and not knowing hunger once in my life, for being me, for being alive, and never having to fear death, for my wife, and her trust in me, for my parents, and their support for me, for all the people that tell me the truth. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- So many things may be worrying you right now, I know that worries plague you all the time, that they hit, when you are the most vulnerable. When problems seem to overshadow the truth. I know that in your mind there seem to be only darkness, but look on it differently, look on your self from the above, what do you seem, yes one of many, and all the others have the same problem as you, they suffer as well, they feel pain as well, they have problems as well, so look, how can you solve them with what is under your controll?
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how hard and dark things might seem, you must push on, you must choose to never give up, never back down, you must go on, never looking back, only seing back on what have you done wrong, only seing the truth like and eagle far away.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- You controll your [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], and nothing else, so use your Judgment to take action.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
