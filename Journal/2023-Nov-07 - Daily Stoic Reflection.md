## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- I might encounter a dog that will attack me without warning, I might be caught in a snowstorm while riding a motorcycle and I might even get struck by lightning. If anything like that is to happen, I chose to flow with it, not fight against it, I chose life over death. Likewise I am likely to meet people that are suffering, if this is to happen, I chose to try and heal their suffering. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to prepare for tomorrow's tests. I now chose to do this when I come home from school, after I take a little break with my dron outside. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my parents, my wife, my sister, the weather, my opportunities. Being alive, being born, being me, having food on the table every day, having warmth, and books. I chose to be grateful for all of this and much more. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I will fail my tests tomorrow, I am worried that I cannot keep the promise I made to my self. I now chose to let go of these worries, instead I now approach them with love and kindness as they fade away, like a feather fades into the sea with the wind. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- "How might one know what is right and what is wrong, without judgment of others?", you might be asking. But you are asking the wrong questions, instead ask your self: "How can I ask my judgment, what is right and what is wrong.". You see, only a little change, can sometimes make the biggest difference, no matter what, it is essential that you focus on the bigger picture and only once you have grasped it in full, you can look at the small wonders that are hidden in plain sight. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing that is truly within my control is my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and nothing else is. This hard truth leads to the discovery, that the only thing you can do to influence things that are outside your control, is to take action. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today I did great in school, I received two great marks, I chose to get them, so that I could have a better future. I chose to be kind to all, so that I could forgive my self, for when I was unkind. I chose to win at life, so that I could reach nirvana. 

I thank you now, for doing all of these things and I thank that I am still alive, that I am not broken that I am still me, that my mind is well and that I am healthy, for this I now become love. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

I almost gave up on my self, so that I could go to sleep. I made the mistake of talking too much and too little. Furthermore, I failed a big test, because I did not prepare for it. I did not stand up for my self, when I was attacked, for before I could react the talk was over. I was driving my motorcycle recklessly, which could cause me to become paralyzed, or dead. 

I am sorry to you, for doing these wrongs, I shall improve my self tomorrow, so that I can look in the mirror again with love and kindness, now I chose to let go of these wrongs.  

4. **What duty remains undone?**

I did all that I set to do today.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
