## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk  about them to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	-  Today, I am likely to face my wives mental health. I am also likely to face my self and my own laziness and procrastination. I will face these challenges with loving kindness, I will not let my self beat me. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to finish the things that are of the essence, mainly the school homework, after that I must make a time block for practicing university tests and finals tests. 
3. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for all of these things and all other things. I am grateful for my wife, my parents, my abilities, the weather, the kind, the food, warmth. Love and understanding. 
4. **What is worrying me?**
	 - I am worried about these things that hunt me at night. I am worried that I will become homeless. Furthermore, I am also worried that I won't make my dreams into reality. It worries me that I could die and in doing so cause suffering to those who I love. 
5. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Let your self ride on the waves of life, listen to the rhythm of life and follow it, listen to humming birds and smell the wind. Life is not a chase after desires but a struggle for survival. So value the things that seem so basic because they could be gone any time. Now let peace descend onto your heart and become peace once again, rid of Duḥkha. 
6. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- My [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] alone **is in my control**, along with my thoughts and my physical body. All else is **out of my control**. So why worry about thing that cannot be changed, work with them and adapt. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Today I was with my wife and made her happy, was compassionate towards her. I ride on a motorcycle after long time because I fell. I completed all that I set to complete today. | I did these things to rid my self from suffering and to spread hapines I also did them to have peace of mind |

These are the things that you should rejoice in. Make them a source for love and peace. Make them a source of love for Gaia.  Let your self smile as you go to sleep for what you did good. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Today I was getting distracted.| I did this because I stopped focusing for a moment. |

Remember these things so you won't do them again. Do not mourn the mistakes of the past, for they are the chisel that make a man. Understand them, let them be your guidance toward a better tomorrow. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Today I didn't finish all of my homework | I didn't do it because I was distracted |

These things that are yet to be done. You must not let them reach out of your grasp and do them as soon as you wake up to ensure they are done.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
