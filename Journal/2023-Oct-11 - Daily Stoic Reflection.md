## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	1. - I am likely to be surprised by the unexpected, if this happens, I am going to remain calm and collected.  
	2. - I am likely to feel negativity, if this happens, I won't absorb the negativity.
	3. - I am likely to feel unmotivated today, If this happens, I am going to push thought it. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	1. - Today I have to look at the tests I am going to do. 
3. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. - I am grateful for my wife, my parents, my life, being alive, having warmth, having peace, being unbreakable, standing my ideals, nature, sounds of nature, my mentors, my friends, the internet, the books, my education. 
4. **What is worrying me?**
	1. - I am worried that I don't have enough time. Because there is little time for all that I want to do.
	2. - I am worried that I will be uncompassionate toady.
	3. - I am worried that I am losing the connection with my self.
5. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	1. - And I say, go into nature and let the birds hum bring you to a still as you wonder over life, and suddenly your problems will feel like a needle in a haystack. Let your mind come to a stand still as you let your self come to rest. Sometimes we forget that we are only human and no gods above, deciding the fate of all what is alive and what is not. You are no master of Gaia, let her song guide you, as you walk the path of suffering with pride. Slow down and enjoy her song, for you are still alive.
6. **What is within my control and what is not**
	1. - My [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is **in my control**.
	2. - My mind **is under my control**.
	3. - Other people are **not under my control**.
	4. - The events of today are **not under my control**

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| - I was kind to all | - I did this because you are only living once |
| - I took a walk in nature  | - I did this cleans my self |
| - I said what was on my mind | - I did this to be my self |
| - I completed what I wanted to complete today | - I did this to have peace |

Thank you for all of these things, I am very happy for you and you did good to do these things. I am grateful to you for completing all of these things, you did very well on them. You used your time good today and tomorrow you shall keep it up. I believe in you. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| - Today I was not paying full attention in class | - I did this because I felt very tired  |
| - I was going too fast | - I did this because I lost my focus |
| - I was making hurtful jokes | - I did this out of insecurity  |

Even thought you did wrong, it's ok. You are but a human, an imperfect being. You can make a few small mistakes, but for tomorrow, before you do anything, pause. Then you will understand what will your action bring and if you should do it. Now don't beat your self up over your mistakes, accept them and learn your lesson, tomorrow you won't make the again.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| - You have yet to complete maturita preparations | - I was playing Table Tennis |
| - You need to finish the books you have started | - I didn't do this because I forgot |

It's ok, tomorrow is another day. You had a lot to do today and the time you had wasn't enough. Sleep well so tomorrow you have enough energy to complete today's duty. Now go to sleep peacefully.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
