## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, I am likely to encounter a lot of negative emotions. I am also likely to procrastinate. Furthermore, I am likely to give up today. If any of these things are to happen, I will treat them with loving kindness and compassion, I will not give up on my self, not today, not tomorrow not util I'm dead in the grave.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I chose to read the books that will improve my life. If I got any spare time, I chose to spent time with my wife, if she has time, if not I will print the first practice test and prepare it for tomorrow. I chose to do all of these things of my own free will. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my parents, my sister, my wife, being alive, having food and warmth, having knowledge, having wisdom, understanding, Buddhism, stoicism, kindness, love and my luck. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I don't have enough time for all the thing I want to do. I am worried that I can't do the things I set to do,
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You see the staving homeless on the street, his feet purple and his fingers black. That man is fighting for his life, that is a problem. Now what problems do you really have. You've got a perfect wife, parents, smarts so why are you upset, why do you think that your problems should put you down. You are not fighting for your life like the man on the street, you are not about to die from terminal illness and even if you were, you would choose the things that are right, you would do your best. So do your best now while you are still alive and them when you're dying on that bed, or in the mountains how you wanted, you can say with peace in your heart to those you love: "It's ok, now go and live well for your self this life does not end with me, so go and live happily. Not for me, but for your self.".
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- My [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is under my control, and nothing else really is. So now I chose to use my judgment that I can control to improve my self and the world around me. To make people and my self happy.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

I did what I set to do, I found balance between family my self and work, I was free, I was peace, I did my reflections, I did not panic. I did these things to become a better human being and to build my self up again from dust. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

I did some things without even thinking about them. I made so judgments without choosing to do them. Likewise, I was going too fast. Furthermore, I did these things because I lost focus. They are done and cannot be changed, so tomorrow make it better, don't fall into the old, harmful habits that won't take you anywhere. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

I didn't read the full book, only a part, I still have to buy motorcycle gear and every day without it is a hazard. I didn't do these things because other things came that were more important to me at the moment. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
