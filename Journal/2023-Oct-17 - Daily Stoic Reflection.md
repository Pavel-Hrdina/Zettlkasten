## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to face many difficult people. I mustn't return their kindness, instead I must approach them with loving kindness. I am also likely to face cold weather today. Furthermore, I am also likely to experience many adversities today, that I can't think of. In this case, I will not panic, instead I will approach this situation with calm and collected mind and I must make the best possible outcome.   
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- My most important tasks today are: buy gratefulness notebook, finish notes and appointment. I must do them today, and I will. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	-  I am grateful for my wife, my parents, my sister, nature, my friends, the weather, having warmth and food, being loved, finding peace, books, internet, computers, craftsmen and for me.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	-  I am worried that the setbacks from yesterday will hurt me today. I am worried that the human race is committing a suicide. Furthermore, I am worried that I will come late to work today because of the traffic. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Your problems are only a small setback that will in the in end help you to great take leaps forward. These adversities are but stepping stones on your path to become the best you can be in this life. But you mustn't beat your self up. I hear you say, "you are such an idiot", "you should hang your self for this...". The only way you can accept these adversities is by practicing loving kindness towards them and to your self.  
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- My [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is in my control, and it is upon me only what actions I chose to take today, only I decide upon this. Anything else is out of my control, but it will not affect me. When the time comes, and it will, when you have to face these great challenges, you mustn't succumb to them, but rather face them like the seashore faces the waves of the rageful sea and their infinite number, that are cast, as to punish them, by the god of sea him self.  

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| -                 | -              |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| -                 | -              |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| -                 | -              |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

- 

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
