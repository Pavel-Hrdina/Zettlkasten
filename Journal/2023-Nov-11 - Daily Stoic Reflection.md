## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to have no internet on my main computer, I am likely to make difficult choices, I am likely to have little time, I am likely to feel very bad, and I am likely to be cold. These and other difficulties I now chose to accept with love, without complained and with peace in my heart, I shall not wither away, for these won't break me, they won't be in my way, for as long as I am alive and my heart is beating I chose to not give in, to not give up.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to learn German again, so that when we write the big test, I will be prepared, so that I can become the best. So that I can speak German. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my mother, my father, my wife, my sister, warmth, food to eat, book to read, things to do and all the things that I can't think. I chose to be grateful for them. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I am not doing enough, that I don't have enough time, that I must choose between two bad options. I now chose to leave these worries behind, I chose to let them go.   
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter what problems you might be facing, the next day, it will all be alright, you will not succumb to your weakness and you will win.  
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing under my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and nothing else is. With this new-found knowledge, you will now use it for good and for becoming better as a person. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
