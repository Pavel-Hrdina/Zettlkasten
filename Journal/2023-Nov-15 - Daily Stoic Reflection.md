## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- I might experience things, that will hurt me, that will make me doubt my self. I might meet people who will be ugly, arrogant and make fun of me for who I am, but I must prevail, I might be sick, but I am not dead yet and for as long as I am alive I chose to not give up. These things that might be obstacles for me, I chose to leave behind me with love and kindness, because when I'm dead, what will they say? They will say things based on what kind of person I was, and I shall live on like that until forgotten or until I achieve nirvana.  
1. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to sit down and think for some time and I chose to do this, and I will do this.
2. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my mother, my father, my sister, being alive, being me, having food on the table every day, for being warm and for having enough, for nature and time, for the adventures I can experience in my life, the freedom I have and for peace. I chose to be grateful for all of these things and all the good things that might come my way today.
3. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I will fail my self again. That I will not be able to do, what I set to do. That I will procrastinate.  
4. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You might be thinking how bad you have it; Say no to these thoughts of unkindness that are compassionless. You must let life chose its own path, you cannot push things that are unnatural to be so, you will only find disappointment. Likewise, you must flow with the web of life and all of its difficulty, with the thread you have been give, you must accept that anything unlucky that happens, you can't change what happens outside your own action. You must accept that no matter how hard you try, you will only put your self down this way. Instead, don't try at all, don't try to swim, against the river's current, instead let the river guide your direction, let it take you to your destination. Now, you might be thinking that the river is taking you to a place, where you don't want to be. But think again, what opportunities will this new place bring, what people you might meet at the river's end, what things you might see.  
5. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- You can only control one thing, my friend, that is your [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md) and nothing else, only your own action is within your control. So now go and take action that you believe is right. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

My actions today were good, I made sure to wake up early, earlier than tomorrow, I was kind, yet not a doormat, I was my self, yet I was not mean or aggressive or hateful. I was courageous, letting my wisdom teeth be taken out. I read today and I completed all that I set to complete for today, and I overcame my own laziness. 

I did these things for my self and others, I chose to do them to live according to nature and to its order. The actions I took today, I chose to do, I made the decision that I shall do this, and then I took action, knowing full well what I was about to do. I that you for this, I thank you for being you and for improving your self every day.  

2. **What did I do wrong?**

I almost doped my motorcycle, because I was careless. I also felt anger toward my mother when I thought she was talking nonsense, but I quickly let my anger go and didn't show it. I was loosing focus a lot today. I must focus more naturally tomorrow and this shall go away without force, without violent pushing of my self, that is not the way.   

4. **What duty remains undone?**

I finished all that I set to do today. Tomorrow I must put more on me, so that I can say that this is not the case. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
