## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may be cold, you may meet people who are mean, arrogant, disrespectful, hateful and unkind, you may be stuck in traffic, and you may feel lazy, unmotivated and sad, you may also feel pain and suffer. You mustn't let any of these put you down, you mustn't let any of them make you give up, you must continue on your journey, you must choose to accept your self and then conquer your self, you choose to become the best, you must choose all of these things to be the man you want to be, to be happy, you could end you if you don't go for your dreams, if you don't do what makes you happy, what you believe is right, what is the point of living then? What else than living according to nature and its laws.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I need to finish my assignments and prepare for the test tomorrow. You will do this today, and you must do this today no matter what, you just do it and don't let it pile up. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I choose to be grateful for my parents, my wife, my sister, being alive, being me, books, understanding, nature, life, kindness, happiness, Buddhism, ancestors. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you are not enough, that you can't do what is right, that by being you, you lose people around you, that you are too kind, that you are not doing enough. All of these things are untrue, or they are out of your control, so let go of them, what good will these thoughts do for you, how are they helpful to you? What do you think will they do to you? These thoughts must be banished from your soul, they have no place amongst the good and natural in you, so banish these thoughts, like you would banish an unwanted guest. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You must think that there is no hope, you must think that you are fighting for nothing, but no, instead think like this; One: ,,If I give up, that I gave up on life and I shall be dead.''; Two: ,,remember that you are fighting for the light at the end of the tunnel, that you are fighting for your self and for the future''. Never let anyone, and I mean anyone, not even your self, doubt you, you can't be the best, if you doubt your self. How can you have the strength to win, if you don't even believe that it is possible for you to win? So think like that and choose to push on, to never give in, to never give up, to look for the light of hope that shall guide you to a better tomorrow.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. Choose to use it to live according to nature if you know this if you know that you can't control anything else and only your action, that choose to take it, even if the action looks meaning less, you must choose to act in order to live with your nature, with your *soul*.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today, you did all the things that you set out to do. You did them because you believed in your self. You remained in control of your mind, you motivated your self, and you did what was essential. You did all of these things, because you choose to be your best self, because you choose greatness, so never give up on this dream, don't let anybody tell you, how to live your life, and then you will be free, allow your self to dream big, to be who you truly are. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

I laughed when there was no need to laugh, I also talked wrong about people. I dislike them and I laughed because I felt like it. Let these things slide and be happy,

4. **What duty remains undone?**

You did all that you set out to do today.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
