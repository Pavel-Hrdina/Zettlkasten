## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may feel like you did something wrong, like you can't do something right, as if you were responsible for all the troubles that have come your way, you may feel tired, you may be with people that are mean, angry, aggressive, ungrateful, unkind, and hateful, you may feel pain, you may be cold, you may fail. All of these things should be the way they are, don't let your self-doubt you, that won't help you, don't let your self-hate you, that won't help you, let others be the way they are, and then prove them wrong, prove all the people that doubted you wrong, and even if you can't, you can try again, and fall and try again, and then fall again and try again until you win! Don't be the one who gets broken, be the one who molds his destiny.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I need to learn for OSP testing today, I know it will be hard, and I am grateful for it, I know I might fail, and I am grateful for it, I know I might be doomed, but I am grateful for it, I know I might die, and I am grateful for it. This has to be done, you live only once, you can't do this twice, so make the most out of what you can, don't let your mind prove to you, that you must relax, that you can't do this anyway, you must work until your bone is visible under your skin, and you shall do so.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my parent, for their support.
	2. For my wife, for her love and strength
	3. For being alive
	4. For being born.
	5. For having energy.
	6. For having love and support.
	7. For having an education. For all of these thing I choose to be grateful for, for they shape me, into the person I am today.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried about your wife's health, you may be worried about the future, you may be worried about your life and others, you may be worried about people being mean and what-not. You must not give in to these dark thoughts, you must instead break them and remold them into thought with purpose, these just lead to weakness, but you need a mind of a warrior, so remolded, they may be a perfect vase right now, but they must be broken and made into one that suits you and your dreams!
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how bad you might feel about your self, and how much you feel like shit, you must push on, you must prove to your self, that you can do this, not to others, but to your self, you are nothing, if you can't do what you belive is right, what you belive has purpouse, you must choose to see the light and go for it, to chase you dreams, wich are here to make you strong, to make you belive your self. No matter what anybody says, you must think and you must chase your dreams!
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing that is within my controll, is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and nothing else is. With this knowledge I must choose to take action, have I been born to lie in my bed, in its warmth, until I cannot live without it? No, I have been born with suffering from the past, I have been born and now I must relive my self from it, and relive my self from the suffering of others, and that is impossible, if I do nothing and lie in my bed all day.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

**Today's Events** 

- Today, you woke up, you went to school, you were in the school and you paid attention, you wrote 2 test, that you didn't know of, so they weren't under your control, then you went home you watched Netflix for 2 hours, then you were learning for 1 hour, before that you felt sudden rush off panic that told you, I am alive, I exist, and now you are about to go to sleep.

**How I see them in the near future?**

-  These events will help you realize your mortality, they will are here to show you, that you could die any minute now, right now you could be dead, and what will things and the material be then, you will be dead and what off it?

**How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?**

- They will be seen as a normal part of my youth, nothing spectacular, nothing grant.

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
