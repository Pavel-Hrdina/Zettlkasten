## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I may feel down, I may feel sad, I may meet people that are, mean angry, suffering, ungrateful, unhappy, arrogant and mean in general, I may also be cold, in pain and suffering, I may feel guild and I may feel unmotivated. You must choose to overcome all of these difficulties, that are to happen to you, no matter what will happen to you, you must choose to be better, you must choose to be kind and loving to your self and others and to live your life, so that you are happy, so that your life is fulfilled. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I need to buy the notebook for my penmanship practise. I choose to do this today, I choose to do this, to not let my self down, I choose to eat that frog.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, for my wife, for my sister, for being me, for being alive, for being disciplined, for being organized, for books, for my ancestors, for technology, for warmth, for food, for nature, for peace, for being, for nothingness, for life.  
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you can't do anything, that you are too lazy, that people are right, that you are weak, that you are too sensitive
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
