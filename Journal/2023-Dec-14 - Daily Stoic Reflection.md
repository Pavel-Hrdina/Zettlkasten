## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I may feel down, I may feel sad, I may meet people that are, mean angry, suffering, ungrateful, unhappy, arrogant and mean in general, I may also be cold, in pain and suffering, I may feel guild and I may feel unmotivated. You must choose to overcome all of these difficulties, that are to happen to you, no matter what will happen to you, you must choose to be better, you must choose to be kind and loving to your self and others and to live your life, so that you are happy, so that your life is fulfilled. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I need to buy the notebook for my penmanship practise. I choose to do this today, I choose to do this, to not let my self down, I choose to eat that frog.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, for my wife, for my sister, for being me, for being alive, for being disciplined, for being organized, for books, for my ancestors, for technology, for warmth, for food, for nature, for peace, for being, for nothingness, for life.  
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you can't do anything, that you are too lazy, that people are right, that you are weak, that you are too sensitive, that you are like stone, that you are dumb, that you are unkind and mean. That you will fail, that you will die, that you can't do anything. Now let go of these worries, think, what are they worth? How do they help you go forward, how do they help you become your best self? They don't do any of these things, they only put you down and take your confidence and sense of self-worth away, they make you crumble they make you suffer, so let them go in peace and don't let them make you give up, never ever let your worries get under your skin. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how hard it might seem, you must push on, you must be as calm, as the sound of a foresst, you must be peace, you must never give up on your dreams and push on to greatness, only then will your life be fufilled, so no matter how bad things might look, push on! PUSH ON! Don't give up on your self, don't you dare. Go for your dreams, go, make the moast out of your day, make the moast out of your life. What do you get from lying in your bed? Nothing, So get up and do something worth your time, you are not a idiot, you know this, you know that you have what it takes, the only thing you must choose to have is curage, so don't let it bother you, if others are the way they are, if they live acording to theyir nature, it's ok to feel emotions, it's ok to make mistakes, your duty is to get up after every fall and belive me you will fall so many times, and yet you must get up again and again, ony then you can say that you have lived a good life.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
		- The only thing within my controll is my own [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md), nothing else is. Choose to use your judgment to get the moast out of your life, life is but a grain of sand in the hourglass of time, you life is so short, so why sweat the small suff. Choose to act on you desicions, choose to speak when you feel the need to speak and don't let anyone step on your neck, fight like a lion,  

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
