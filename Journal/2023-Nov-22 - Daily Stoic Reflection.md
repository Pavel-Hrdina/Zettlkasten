## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You are likely to meet people who are angry, mean, ugly, hateful, disrespectful, you might also be cold, you might be upset, you might fail, you might encounter any of these things, but they are not here to punish you, nothing that nature has created is neither good nor bad. So if you face these difficulties, do not be sad, do not be angry, let go of them, let your self float on the sea of difficulty, do not let your self be sunken down by resisting it.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- You need to be calm and let things come and go, you need to go at your own speed, and then you must learn at your own pace, you must do every task fast enough but no so fast that you will make a mistake. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- Parents, sister, wife, being alive, books, being me, having food to eat every day, having people to love, having support, being war, having food to eat every day. These things I chose to be grateful.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You might be worried because of the challenges you are facing right now, you might be worried about time, and you might even think, that you trying hard is worth less. Now think again, how truthful are these things, how real are these worries, why does your mind bother you with them? It's simple, your mind tells you this way: "Do this, or you will face the consequence", your mind is trying to tell you something, your intuition is trying to warn you. So let go of these worries, there is nothing to be afraid of, there is nothing you can do outside to action. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how bad things might look, you mustn't give up, no matter how many times you fail over and over again, you mustn't give up, you must push thought the pain and the suffering, you must overcome what you believed was ever possible, what you thought you could do, push beyond that, with love and peace of heat, not aggressively, not with suffering, but instead calmly and collected.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. So go and use your judgment to take action, do not waste a moment, think what is worth your time, what is essential, what you have to do and then do it without complaint.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

You achieved a balance between relaxation and work today. You set your priorities for today. This is a big stepping stone for you, just make sure that you don't tip the scaled and sometimes, you can choose what is more important for you.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

Today you did things that you have forsaken, that you have chosen to not do ever again. Make sure to not make the same mistake tomorrow, make sure to be a bit better every day and night until you are dead. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

I did all that I set to do today 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
