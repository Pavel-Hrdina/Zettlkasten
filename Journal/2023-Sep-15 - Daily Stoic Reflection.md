> anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation 
> and complaint.”

> [!quote]  Epicurus
> “Meditate then, on all these things, and on those things which are related 
> to them, both day and night, and both alone and with like-minded 
> companions. For if you will do this, you will never be disturbed while 
> asleep or awake by imagined fears, but you will live like a god among 
> men. For a man who lives among immortal blessings is in no respect 
> like a mortal being.”
