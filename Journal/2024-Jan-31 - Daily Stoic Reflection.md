## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_
^193c83
### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may feel bad, you may feel all different emotions, you may meet people that dislike you, that are mean to you, and that are ungrateful for your kindness. You may also be faced with the wrongs you did in the past, you may be faced with you past, you may have to deal with your shadows, and demons, before you can continue.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I will do all my tasks in the task list, and then, I will learn for the OSP testing. I choose to do this today, because I want to, not because I need to, not because I must, not because I have to, but because it is my calling, it is what I want to do today, and I choose to do it.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my parents, and their kindness towards me.
	2. For my wife, and her never ending pool of pure love.
	3. For having trust in my self, and for helping others.
	4. For being me, and being alive.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- It worries you, that you might fail, it worries you, that you might die, it worries you, that you are feeling blue, it worries you that you are feeling so tired. Think this way: "Sometimes, we have a bad day, other times, we have days that are even worse.", so think, how bad is this day really? How bad it is to feel a little blue, and worry about your own failure, you are not the only one who feels like that, everybody does. So think, what can I do, to improve my condition? What can I do to make my self feel better? If the answer is: "I can't.", then think again, what is in your mind, is also under your control.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- I see the natures' beauty every day, and then I think: "What a wonderful day.", but don't forget that a day that is all wrong, is also beautiful, because it was made by nature, so it's good, it's how it's supposed to be, it's how it should be. Nature is the force you must follow, nature will give you hints, it will guide you to the place you want to be in, we have lost our connection wiht it. "But how do I find it?", you might say. It is in mustic that we can find out lost connection with nature, so go and find it again.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
