## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to experience hatred, people that are angry, suffering, mean and unhappy, sadness, bad weather and many more things that might surprise me. In the case of adversity I will not yield to it, instead I chose to accept it with loving kindness and calmness and use my judgment to act on it.   
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to pick up my package. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my parents, my wife, my sister, my self, being alive, being healthy, food, warmth and for many more things I am grateful for. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried about time and my intellect. These things worry me and I chose to accept them for what they are. I chose to stop fighting them and I let go of the worries. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- I know how you feel, that feeling of despair is lurking inside your soul. Its painful bites remind you that you are still alive, that you are not dead yet, that it's not the end yet. So get up from the ground, get up from the bed every morning and fight your destiny, flow with your self and take action, because you are not dead yet and for as long as you are alive you can still do something, only the dead now know nothingness and for as long as you are alive you will choose to push again you. You know you are no idiot, so why do you put your self down? 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- My [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is within my control and I chose to use it for good. Nothing else I can control.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today I overcame my self, even when I felt down I pushed against me. I did this to become my best self. I made others laugh and made them happy. Not only that, but I did this to reduce suffering in this world. Not only that, but I was like a wall for my wife, when she needed me. I did this to be a stable for her, so that she knows that every time she has a problem, I will react with peace and compassion. I realized my primal anger and let go of it before it could take a hold of me. Likewise, I did this to control my self, using my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]].

2. **What did I do wrong?**

Today, I said things that should have been kept in my head. I did this because I lost control over my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]].

4. **What duty remains undone?**

3 tasks are not yet complete, and I chose to work on them tomorrow morning. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
