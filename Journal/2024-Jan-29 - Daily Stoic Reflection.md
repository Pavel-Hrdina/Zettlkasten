## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_
### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may meet people that will be mean to you, that will hate you, that will disagree with you. You may find your self feeling all bad and wrong, and you may think how horrible you got it. You may be stuck in traffic, and you may be cold. You must never give up on what you believe to be right, and what should be done, I believe that you, can do the things that you want to do, that you love from the bottom of your heart. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to once again dedicate time to learning. Nothing is more important right now, and so you will do it without fail, I believe you can do this.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my parents, for my wife, for being alive, for being me, for having trust in my self, for knowing what is right, for doing what must be done, for believing in my self, for trust.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you have no time, to do the things you must do, you may be worried that you will fail, and you may feel like you can do nothing right, only wrong, don't let your self fall into the trap of fear, and hate. Think of all the people that you love, and what else could you do for them, then to love your self, think on the present, think on how lucky you are to be alive, how lucky to see what is to come, how lucky to have food every day, so abandon you fears, because there is nothing to fear, only the darkness in your own heart. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You may think how horrible things are for you, you may think how bad you have it, you may think: ,,Why me? What have I done? Why am I disliked?". Well abandon these thoughts, they only bring you suffering, instead, choose to see what really need to be seen, the truth, the pain, and your own mistakes, so instead of doing nothing, get up, and do what you must, then do what you want, I know that every day seem worse that the other, but as one wise man said: ,,If the path you are on seems too easy, you are on the wrong path.".
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- I control my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], I control my mind, I control what action I choose to take. These things I control, so then, if I make a mistake, I will not blame my self, I will accept it with open, and loving arms, and then think on how could I have improved, what could have been done, and would it work. Then I can take action, then I can command my body to move, then I can command my self to do what is right.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
