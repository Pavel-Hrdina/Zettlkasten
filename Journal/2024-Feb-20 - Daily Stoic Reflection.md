## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Laziness, people, hate, traffic, stress, sickness, cold, meanness, hate, loneliness, sleepiness, unkindness, craziness.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you choose to learn, today, you choose to be your best self.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my mother, for my father, for my wife, for being me, for being alive, for being alive, for trust, for peace, for democracy, for love, for emotions, for work, for existing.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- That you will fail, that your text will be bad, that you are not good enough, that you can't do what is right, that you will lose, that you will fail, that you will fear, that you will not face your self, that you will be lazy, that you can't do the right thing.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You may lose, yet you must come back up, you may fail, yet you must get back up, you may fall, yet every time, you must get back up on your feet, every time, you must go again, and again, and again. "Why?", you might ask. It is simple, because you could be dead this very moment, and that is why you get up, so that when you are dying, you can feel at peace, without a worry in the world, just love and compassion for all beings, and if you feel that you could have done better, that you will feel hate, and guilt.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], my mind, what I choose to do, how I react, who I talk with, who do I support.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

	You did all your duties today, and you have learned for the OSP testing, you did what you had to, and for that I congratulate you, good job, and keep it up.

1. **What did I do wrong?**

	Today, I was almost angry, and that would result in my day being destroyed. 

2. **What duty remains undone?**

	I haven't let go off my worries, I must stop procrastinating on this matter. 

3. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

	Tomorrow, I will do my best at tests in school, so that I could win.

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
