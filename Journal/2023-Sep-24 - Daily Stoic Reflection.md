> “How unlucky I am that this should happen to me. But not at all. Perhaps, say 
> how lucky I am that I am not broken by what has happened, and I am not 
> afraid  of what is about to happen. For the same blow might have stricken 
> anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation 
> and complaint.”

> [!quote]  Epicurus

> asleep or awake by imagined fears, but you will live like a god among 
> men. For a man who lives among immortal blessings is in no respect 
> like a mortal being.”

### The Gravestone Method

> [!quote]

## A VIEW FROM ABOVE

_This exercise is designed to reminded you about how small you really are, and how little importance most things have. In other words, to give you a sense of the bigger picture. It's quite simple, use your imagination to try and relate yourself to the whole world and beyond._

I see my self sitting writing this, I like the center of the world, CEO of my little box world. I look further, now I look just like an ant between others, insignificant yet useful my view shifts now I am but another living organism a part of a bigger system, part of a bigger plan. Furthermore, I am powerless to the power of fate and the whim of the bigger things. An ant, lost in a colony so big, that the queen is dying. Now I see the planets as they rotate around the sun, I see the galaxy itself, from here, I am nothing but a flash in time of the universe, I will die, and the universe will continue to exist for ever and ever and ever. I may be reborn as many times as there are stars, but I will never be able to control time, fate or anything but my self.
