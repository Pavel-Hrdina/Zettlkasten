## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_
### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may be cold, you may feel bad, you may feel wrong, and you may find others hateful, and ungrateful. You may hurt your self, and you may think wrong thought, and you may be sick.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to relax.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my wife, for my parents, and for my emotions, for my ancestors, for my brothers, for the people that support me, for the weather, for nature, for being alive, for being me, for having trust in my self.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you are not going to make it, that you will lose, that you will fail, that you can't do things right, that you are not doing the right thing, that you will have no time, that you could die today, that you could hurt your self. Think about how truthful these things are, think about how helpful they are to you, and then, put them in a place, put them into a void where they disappear, like time.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You see the dark in every corner, I know, but why, what darkness is really there, that you are worried about? What wrong will you find in the darkness, what if the dark, is full of opportunities, yes, you don't know what's in there, but how do you know if you don't enter it. So abandon your fear, abandon your fear of dark, life, and death, these things are only here, to suppress you on your journey.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing that is under your control is your own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], so use it, take action, use it, to win over your self. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

1. **What did I do wrong?**

2. **What duty remains undone?**

3. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
