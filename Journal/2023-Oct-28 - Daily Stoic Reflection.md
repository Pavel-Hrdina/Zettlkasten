## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

	- Today I am likely to experience the following adversities: cold, laziness, depression, boredom, hate, self-hate, not enough love. And many more that I am not able to think of.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I have to service my motorcycle. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**

	- Only my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is under my control.
### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today I did not succumb to my emotions and I prevailed victorious over my self. I did this so I could continue forward and move on with my life. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

Today, I was carried a lot of sadness on my shoulders, because I was upset about my wife. I also wasn't able to take responsibility for my own actions because I was upset. I was also exhausted today, I don't know why, I just felt depressed. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

Today I did not 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events

### 4 Virtues Method
