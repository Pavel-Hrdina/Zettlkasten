## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to experience the following adversities: cold, laziness, depression, boredom, hate, self-hate, not enough love. And many more that I am not able to think of.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I have to service my motorcycle. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my mother, father, sister, wife, being alive, nature, weather.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I will be alone.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Nothing lasts forever.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- Only my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is under my control.
### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today I did not succumb to my emotions and I prevailed victorious over my self. I did this, so I could continue forward and move on with my life. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

Today, I was carried a lot of sadness on my shoulders, because I was upset about my wife. I also wasn't able to take responsibility for my own actions because I was upset. I was also exhausted today, I don't know why, I just felt depressed. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

Today I had no tasks.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
