## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to experience these adversities: cold, sadness, weakness,  madness, angrier, mean angry and generally suffering people, change and many more that are unthinkable to me now. If I face any of these adversities today, I choose to face them with loving kindness and understanding, then I chose to act peacefully on them. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to finish my most pressing tasks, my most important tasks, that I have in my task manager. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my parents, my sister, my wife, being alive, being born, the weather, life, the kind, food, warmth and much more I am grateful for.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that life is a dream, that I am, but a part of a simulation a walking dead. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You know that the only thing you can do is take action, so why do you cling to the idea that you need to be in control of all things. Or perhaps you are just covering something up to your self this way, that something happened as you could not control when you were but a child and since you cannot help your self. Or you are a chronic liar I don't know, I am not a psychic to say. You must now go and carve your path, carve the stone you are made of until the diamond under it shines through so bright you are blinded and so is everyone else. Now go and make your dreams a reality, for all it takes is action. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and nothing else is. Now I chose to use my judgment and my actions for good.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
