## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

	3. - I am likely to have my faith and discipline tested. 
2. What one thing do most need to get done today?
	1. - My M.I.T. tasks 
3. What am I grateful for?

5. How can I decatastrophize today's problems?
	1. - You are not a god, nor a stone, you are a human being and every human being that has ever archived greatness has made so many mistakes that I can't even count them. Get rid of the idea that making a mistake is a cardinal sin. If you want to become your best self, you are bound to make mistakes, otherwise you will only stagnate. Think how can you make fewer mistakes, but do not avoid them all together.

	2. - I am **under my control**.
	3. - Everything else **is under my control**. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events

How I see them in the near future?

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?
