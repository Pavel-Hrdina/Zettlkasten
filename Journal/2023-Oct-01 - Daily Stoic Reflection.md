## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. What did I do well today?

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| - Today I was kind to all | - I did this to have no regrets |
| - Today I created a routine for my self | - I did this to reduce the cluster of life and improve my well being |
| - Today I rested | - I did this to prevent my self from burning out like a fire that had too mutche wood  |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

- Today was a peaceful day, no wrong happened, it was a day of joy, jet I was not feeling too well mental, this was because I let things pile on me again, tomorrow I will try to take my time and do what need to be done. 

How I see them in the near future? 

- These events will make me stronger, they will help me to grow my self and to become a better person. 

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

- If anybody will know about them, they will be seen as ordinary and nothing more. 

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
