## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may feel like you have no time, like there is nothing you can do right, you may meet people that are mean, angry, aggressive and unkind. You may be cold and you may be sick. Even if the odds of these difficulties, you must still push on, because otherwise you are going to lose the only thing that you can control, and that is your judgment. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you must complete your duty, you must choose to do what is right, you must choose to finish what you have begun, to do what is needed, and what is right to be done.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. I choose to be gratefull for my mother, my father, my sister, my wife, being alive, being me, understanding, kindness and trust. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried today by all sorts of thing, I can feel it in your heart. It's pointless to list them all here, they are many I know. But you must choose to push against them, instead of letting them put you down, you must push against the very core of your belifes, you must choose to accept the hard truth and work that way.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter what, push againg the slope of stone that has been put before you, yes I know the task seems impossible at 1st, but when it starts moving, you know you are doing the right things, so push until that stone move, push until you are ash, push until you cannot see anymore and then you may say, you have won against your self.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my controll is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], and nothing else is, so choose to do things your way, choose to do things that you belive are right and then win, win agains time.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

	Today, I did well all the things that I should have done, I did all my work, I had success and I put my health first, I took time for things that had to be done.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

	I put my self down thought unconscious action. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

	You did all the things that were your duty today, congratulation.

6. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

	Tomorrow, I will make all my decisions with my conscious mind, not with the mind of the dream. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
