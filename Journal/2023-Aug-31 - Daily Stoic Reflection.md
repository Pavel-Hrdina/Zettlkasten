### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> “How unlucky I am that this should happen to me. But not at all. Perhaps, say 
> how lucky I am that I am not broken by what has happened, and I am not 
> afraid  of what is about to happen. For the same blow might have stricken 
> anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation 
> and complaint.”

> [!quote]  Epicurus
> “Meditate then, on all these things, and on those things which are related

> companions. For if you will do this, you will never be disturbed while 
> asleep or awake by imagined fears, but you will live like a god among 
> men. For a man who lives among immortal blessings is in no respect 
> like a mortal being.”

## A VIEW FROM ABOVE

_This exercise is designed to reminded you about how small you really are, and how little importance most things have. In other words, to give you a sense of the bigger picture. It's quite simple, use your imagination to try and relate yourself to the whole world and beyond._

I am but a small man in a sea of time that moves with, or without, me. I feel but nothing else can feel the same, I hear, but nothing can hear the same, I see, but nothing can see the same. Furthermore, I live for so short yet for so long. Everything I do has a purpose that is hidden to me. The problems I have now won't exist in a week. The same goes for problems I face tomorrow. In the grander scheme of things, I will be dead so fast that nothing will even happen. The universe moves in a speed of its own, the speed of life is not the speed of light, **the faster you go, the faster you die**, take life slow or you will run before you learn to walk. Human being all look like ants when you look form high enough, and every single one has problems, yet none of these problems don't mater in the grand scheme of things, the universe will move on, in its own speed and there is nothing we can do about that. **Tomorrow, keep this in mind when you get impatient**

## MEDITATIONS ON THE IDEAL MAN
