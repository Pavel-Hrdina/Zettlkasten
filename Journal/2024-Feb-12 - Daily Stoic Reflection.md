## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may find that people are mean, that have no time, that you are human. You may enocuter bad people, lack of self discipline, lack of time, you may be stuck in a trafic jam, you may feel pain, you may feel sick, you may feel unhappy, you may feel purpouseless, you may be tired, the weather might be bad, you may fail, you may do bad at table tennis, you may die.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I once again need to learn for the OSP testing, that is what must be done, that is what I choose to do, that is what I will do, and I will push my self to my limits. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my mother, for my father, for being me, for being healthy, for being alive, for being born, for my wife, for my life, for my mentors, for all the people.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- Life is worrying you, people are, time is, death is, and other things that are not under your control, remember, you can't control these things, so let go of worrying about them, it won't help you, and it won't help them. So remember that fear is a mind killer.
1. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- I know that things seek hard, yes I know, but why do they seem hard? It's only in your heart that it seems wrong, so let go of any thoughts about problems, instead look at your problems in a different light, and you might find that the solution, is quite simple.
2. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- You control your [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], your actions, your decisions, so do just that, and do what is within your power.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

	Today, I was kind, I did my best to control my self, even though, I have not been always successful, yet, it's a big leap to become a better you, so continue on your path, and you shall see where you are taken.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

	I have talked when I wasn't supposed to talk. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

	Toady, you did all that was your duty.

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

	Tomorrow, I will say onlly what must be said, and all else, I will keep to my self, I will let others aproach me if they want to, and give love to all.

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
