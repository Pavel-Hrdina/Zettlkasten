## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to face crazy people, bad weather, bad decisions, failure and my own self. I chose to conquer these adversities with calm and collected mind without complained or hate, and I chose to absorb them with peace and leave them where they 1st happened.  
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I have to pick books for maturita and start reading. I also need to learn German for a little bit.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my parents, my wife, being alive, being in peace, having food every day, having warmth and having being me. I chose to be grateful for these and many more things I am grateful for. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I will fail today, I am worried that I can't decide, I am worried that the world is getting too fast for me. This very moment, I chose to abandon these thoughts of worry that plague my mind like a poison of the mind that has no known cure and is worse than any poison the body could endure. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You might start to believe that courage is something you must be born with that discipline has to be built from early childhood, that a human being that hasn't been crafted by a mold is nonetheless useless and becomes a fool and a degenerate. Stop these thoughts calmly now, as you could not be further from the truth. So many were so unlucky and without a life set like that, yet they become the best. "How come?", you might be asking. Well the answer is simple, they fed the inner fires that drives the human being to greatness the fires of hope and discipline, and they worked smart, they took their time to think things thought.   
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only things under my control is my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. I chose now to use it for greater good, to take action and help others and your self to live a meaningful life.  

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today I was very talkative because I was in the mood to talk. I also let go of any worries and cluster that I had in my mind, because I wanted to be free and when you are free, the surrounding bullshit is meaningless. I also let go of perfection so that I could make things done. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
