## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You are likely to meet people who are ungrateful, unhappy, unkind, uncompassionate and mean, you are likely to be cold, and you are likely to be stressed, angry and sad, you are likely to get stuck in a traffic jam. All of these things, let them be the way they are, don't try to change them into something they can't be, something that is unnatural to them, so just let go of them, let them be and be kind to them, then they will have no power over you. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- You need to learn again today once you get home, this is very important, so do it today, not tomorrow, not sometime else, today. You must do it, you must choose to conquer your self and your mind, you must choose to do it.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, for my wife, for my self, for my sister, for being alive, for my grandparents, for my friends, for my cousins, for books, for cars, for radio, for computers, for electricity, for knowing my worth, for knowing who to trust, for being human, for being me. All of these things you must choose to be grateful for, for being blessed.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You might be worried that you are not enough, that you are not smart enough, that you are too kind too emotional, that you can't make it, that you are nothing. Yes it's ok for these thoughts to come to mind, but then you must banish them, you must let them go, you must choose to leave them be like the falling leaves that the trees leave be. So do the same, do not be full of the garbage, it will make your mind clouded, and you won't think the way you should; With love and compression.
1. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter what you might be going through, remember how small your problems are in the face of the universe, how much time has passed since the beginning of time, since the beginning of reality; nobody knows. And how much time has passed from before then, before there was something? This proves one thing, that humans are long from understanding, for once they know that matter is only an illusion of the mind, only then they will understand, what things are real, we must banish the thought, that what we can see with our eyes, is the truth.  
2. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. So use the control you have over this aspect of your self, to be good and natural to your self, don't force things to be a certain way, let them be the way they are.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
