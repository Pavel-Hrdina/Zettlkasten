## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you might fail the big test, you might not do enough, you might not be good enough, you might this bad things about your self and put your self down, you might even be unkind to others and hateful to your self, you might be cold and cough all day, you may feel pain and you might feel restless. All of these things are there for you to overcome, they are there, so that you can go and conquer your self, so think about them like this.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to learn for the testing for at least 2 hours when you come home from school, I allow you to relax for 1 hour, and then you will not stop learning until the sun sets. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. I choose to be grateful for my parents and their patience with me.
	2. For my wife and her kindness.
	3. For being alive and being me, for living, for understanding, for trust, for compassion, for the people that love me and for the emotions I can experience, for the pain, that reminds me that I am alive and for my hardship. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you are the most unintelligent person you know, that you can't do anything right and that you are not good enough, that you can't do what you want to do and that you will lose. That is what is worrying you and I know it is hard for you, but you must keep pushing like never before, you must keep going so hard that all will think that you are crazy, you must leave all of your worry behind and find the fire in your heart, that you have awakened, again. You must nourish it and give it food so it grows, and then you will accomplish all your goals, you will win all thing you desire, but before then you must accept defeat and be reborn like a phoenix from your own ashes!
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how dark might you think it looks, it's not bad at all, nothing will happen to you, because you will work for it to not be dark, you will see the light that you are looking for in the darkness, and you will follow it until you are either dead or victorious. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]].

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

	Today, I was thinking about every action I took, I did this, so that I could truly say, that my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgmetn]] is under my control. I did what was my duty, I did it so that I could look at my self tomorrow and be at peace.  

2. **What did I do wrong?**

	Today, I spoke too much, even though I needed to relax my thought so that I would not cough, I did this, because it was required off me. Instead of 2 hours, I only learned for one, this was because I got a headache, so I decided to stop.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

	Today, you did all the duty you could do, not duty to remain undone, that was in your power. This is a great achievement and you should be proud, congratulations.

6. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

	Tomorrow, I will sit down and think, think on what is my duty and what shall I do, I will not act until I choose to, until then I will continue thinking, and then I will set my self into motion.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
