## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**

	- Today, you may find your self thinking, how come I am like this? What have I done to deserver my life? You may want to do things, that are unlike you, you may feel stressed, and you may feel down. You may hurt your self, you may be close to death. The people you love may be close to death. You may feel pain, you may be tired, you may die, you may fall.

2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**

	- Today, I need to relax.

1. **What am I grateful for?**

	1. For my mother, for my father, for my life, for being me, for being alive, for being loved, for loving, for where I am, for where I was born, for democracy, for freedom.

2. **What is worrying me?**

	- My wife is worrying me, my love is worrying me, the things that I may feel worry me.

3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**

	- No matter how hard might things seem, you must feel your self, and accept what is under your control, and what is not under your control. These are the only thing that truly matter for you to be happy and in peace with your self and others.

4. **What is within my control and what is not**

	- Who you are, how you look at things, how you judge others how you think about t he past and the present, how much you trust others, how loved you feel, how loved you make others feel, what you do when you feel tired.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
