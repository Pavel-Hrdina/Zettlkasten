## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may find your self feeling like shit, unproductive, unhappy and dained, you may think how dumb you are, how you can't do anything right, that you are easy to manipulate and what no. You must not let these thing bother you, you must not let them put you down, you must be victotious over and over again agains your self and your destiny, I know you can do this, so DO IT! Win agains the shadown that is you and your ego, leave them behin, and only then you may find peace.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you must prove to your self, that you can do thing, that you though were impossible for you, that you thought you could never do, or accomplish, so go, and do what you belive is right, what you belive should be done and what will move you forward. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my mother and my father, for the never ending love they give me.
	2. For my sister
	3. For my wife, and her kindness even in the darkest moments.
	4. For being alive
	5. For being me
	6. For my grandpa
	7. For my grandma
	8. For my ancestors
	9. For love
	10. For trust
	11. For acceptance
	12. For emotions
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you are dumb, that you have no future, that you can't do what is right, that you are a nobodym don't worry about these thing, they are not real, they only plague your mind, and nothing else, not you body, not others, only you and your soul, but your reason stands fast, unborken, unfaced, so follow its call, your heart may say these thing, but they are not under your controll, so command your heart to help your reason, not cloud it. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how much suffering your might think you are going through, think about those who have lived before you, think about those who will live after you. All people suffer in some way, and the suffering of mind is as bad as the suffering of the body. So accept the suffering you have, all people suffer, all suffer in different ways, but all do. You must stay focused on your light, on the small things that give you hope.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- No matter how hard might things seem the only thing under you controll is your own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]].

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus
