## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may find, that all sort of difficulty comes your way. You may feel exhausted, you may feel like you are at the end of the road, you may think negative thought, you may worry, and you may meet people that are mean, angry, arrogant, ungrateful and unhappy. You may find your self not wanting to do what has to be done. Now all of these things may prove to be too challenging for you, but instead of giving in to them, you must embrace them, you must choose to improve on them and let go of any worry you have about them, you can only accept what comes your way, but it is how you react to it that you can control.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today you must choose to learn once you come home, today you must do this thing, it is the only thing that I ask you to do, nothing else, just this, so be in peace and do what is right.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my parent and their never ending love.
	2. For my wife and her support and kindness to me.
	3. For being alive and for being born. These things are a gift, treasure them.
	4. For my sister, for books, for time, for the present.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you will fail your self today, you may be worried that people will be mean to you, that you will be sick again and all the other stuff that clusters your mind with darkness and hate. You must choose to leave these things leave your heart and let you be at peace with your self and your mind, you must let them leave your body, like water leaves a waterfall at his end.  
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Remember that you have time, that you can take your time and take it peacefully, there is no need for doing things in haste, yes, I know it feel like so little, but remember that everyone has little time and that everyone is going to die, some today, some in 50 years, but none is immortal, not even in thought. So think this way, this, about every action you take before you take it, because it could be your last. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing, that is within my own control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and nothing else is. So choose to take action. But why? What is my action worth, if I can't control the result anyway? Well that is precisely why you should take action, because rather than thinking like this, think what is my life worth, if I don't control the only thing I can? If you choose to not take action, the result will be even worse, then if you choose to.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

	Today, I did what was right, I did what I like, and I did what had to be done, you felt a fire in your heart a fire so strong, that it almost couldn't be controlled, these things, you know what was the right thing to do, and you did that, you can now sleep in peace.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

	You talked to your self today, nobody cared. Don't do that again, it's annoying to people around you, so just don't say anything, listen and do nothing, let your self be bored, it's ok.

3. **What duty remains undone?**

	I did all that I set out to do today, congratulation. You can do something for your self tomorrow, love your self and others and you shall live a good life. 

4. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

	No matter how tired or restless you might wake up. you must do what you must do, that is what sets you closer to your goal, that is what is worth your time and what is essentiall, so do it, get out of your bed and DO what you must, what you have choosen to do every day and don't let your self hate you, be peace and with peace be love. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
