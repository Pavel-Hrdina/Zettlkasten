## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- I might suffer the weather, I might become lazy, I might want to quit the things that I need to do, I might meet people that are mean, angry, aggressive and hateful. All of these things might happen today, but it's not all, there is much more that might surprise you, in the case of such difficulty, you mustn't back down, you must push your self harden, you must remain in absolute control of your self and your judgments according to natures laws. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I choose to pick the books for maturita, I shall do it today, even if the new Buddha him self should be awakened. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my parents, my sister, my wife, that I have food to eat every day, that I have enough, that I am warm, that I am healthy, my lessons, knowing my worth, gaining my understanding of life, knowing, widows, my ancestors. I am grateful for all of these things that, I am grateful that they are in my life, that I was so lucky to have them and that these things gave me and taught me so much about life and being.  
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I will fail, that I will fail my self, that I am not enough, that there will never be a place for me, that I can't do anything right. Do you really believe all of this crap? You are but a  
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
