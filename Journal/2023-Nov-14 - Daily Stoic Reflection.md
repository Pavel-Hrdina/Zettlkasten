## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to fail. I am likely to encounter mean, ugly, disrespectful, sad, suffering people, I am likely to be cold and hungry.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to ace my exam.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my mother my father, my sister, being alive, being healthy, having enough, being warm, having a bed to sleep in, having people who love me, having people who I can love.  
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I am not enough, that I am lazy, that I can't do anything right, that the harder I try, the more I fail.  
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You might believe all of these lies, that your mind has fed you, but you must choose to see though them, to not let them, to not let make you sick, so that you can push thought your hate and your own weakness. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, and you shall reach it, my friend. So do not be discouraged by those who have hurt you, by those who hate you, never let them put you down.  
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and how I chose to use it. It is a question that you know the answer to: "How can I help others, without hurting my self?". No go and make good in this world. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
