## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You might encounter cold, laziness, tiredness, meanness, hate, people who dislike you, who don't like who you are, people who attack you, you might have to endure pain, suffering and your own demons. All of these things might happen to you, all of these things might try you, to make you get off your path, to make you do things that you do not want to do. So instead of letting these things toy with you, let them go, let them leave you, let them be and then, you cannot be effected by them.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today you need to relax and let your self be at peace, you mustn't let your self burn out, do this: be bored and for hours until you can do the work again, don't do anything, don't even read or watch the TV, just get a during or a pipe and watch your mind as long as you need to, don't watch YouTube or anything like that just do nothing at all.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, for my mother, for my sister, for being alive, for being me, for having enough, for knowing my worth, for knowing when to work hard and when to relax, for books and for knowing what is worth my time and what is not, for eating the frog and for stating focused on the things that matter, for being me and for having enough. I chose to be grateful for all of these things, they help me.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You might be worried that you are not doing enough, that your time is running short, that you don't have enough time and energy to do the thing that are necessary to do, that you are worthless and unmotivated without any strength. Now think about these worries, how real are they, how much truth do they contain? Why do you think they are real? These things are the creation of your mind and nothing more, they are but an illusion of the mind. You shall not be distracted by these illusions that try to plague you, poison you, make you fear, make you fail. Discard these thought, let them sink into the sea of darkness that is nothingness, like the sea of its treasures. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You might think, that nothing is worth trying anymore, that you can't do this, that you cannot reach the light, that you are too weak to do what you believe is right, but think, what is real about these thought, what is natural about them, what do they prove? These thought are but a relic of the past, of days long gone and forgotten, so let them be forgotten as well, let them disappear from your mind, leave them with peace in heart knowing that they cannot hurt you, nothing can hurt your mind if you chose to be unhurtable, unbreakable and hard like the diamond shaped by primordial times. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and nothing else is. So not use your judgment to take action. Use it to do what you believe is right, what you believe is worth your time, what you believe in.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

You have chosen to relax today, you have learned to read faster, without loosing comprehension, you have learned how to use the pomodo timer, you have done all that you have chosen to do, and you have prepared for the upcoming week. You have chosen to do these things as an investment into your well-being and into your self, so that tomorrow when you wake up, you can feel reset and full of energy. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

You didn't spend as much time with your wife as you hoped to. You didn't learn for the tests, instead you prepared them. You did these things because you believed that there were more important, pressing things that had to be done. You can forgive your self for now, after all you have chosen to let your self do thing wrong, do things that are not considered to be correct by the majority and that's ok.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

I did all that I set to do today. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
