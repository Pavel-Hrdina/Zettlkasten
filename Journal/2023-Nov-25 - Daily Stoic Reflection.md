## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You might have to face human being that are sad, lonely, unhappy, suffering and mean to you, you might feel bad and worthless lazy and unproductive, you might be cold and in pain, and you might have to face your inner demons. All of these things and others might come your way, but you must not succumb to them, you mustn't let them push you down. Instead of letting them take your energy, make you feel bad or even make you angry, you must accept these things for what they are, you mustn't be put down by them, put to ground. Accept these things as they are, do not be impatient to these things. Let peace and suffering be one with your mind, accept them, do not fight them. In order to make progress, you must also deal with things like this. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- You must choose to prepare for the exams today, you have relaxed a bit yesterday, so today do the work, only then you might get things done and move forward. Do not strive for perfection, strive to get things done and if you are not happy with what is done, improve it util it's done again, and repeat, again and again.  
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, for my wife, for my sister, for warm food every day, for warmth, for knowing, for wisdom, for being me, for being alive, for understanding, for Buddhism, for love, for peace, for emotions, for acceptance, for courage, for the time I have, for knowing what and when, for being resilient, for letting go, for not knowing what has worth and what is not, for knowing my worth. All of these things mean a lot to me, they have helped me a great deal along my way, they have saved me from my demons, from the pain and suffering that the people around me now experience. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You might be worried that you are unloved, that you are dumb, that you are nothing, that the things that everyone says are truthful, that you are weak, that you should have a job and have life figured out. But think, why do these thought creep in your mind like small spiders making webs of worries trying to hurt you, making you doubt your self, making you feel worthless, trying to make you give up, give in. Why do you think, they are there, in your mind like that? It's because the webs need to be cleaned, they need to be put away, they need to be discarded, let go. So let them go, let them leave your mind peacefully, for they are nothing but images made by your fantasy to scare you, to keep you alive, they are but a relic of evolution and the ages long gone, so let them leave with peace and grace, accept them, don't be scared by them, and their meaningless threats. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You are scared, I know that you are, you feel this longing for greatness, you feel the need to be seen and praised, you feel alone. I know all of this, I know that it's hard, I know that you don't trust your self to make things right. You do this because you are afraid to make a mistake, but mistakes are necessary to accept that you have to make them in order to succeed, let your self breathe and say in your head: "It's ok to make a mistake, it's ok if I fail this." and then breathe again. You may find that this freeing, and you may find that you suddenly don't feel stressed at all, for the stress you were feeling was created by you being afraid. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing under my control is my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], what actions I chose to take, what actions I chose not to take and when I chose to do them, what I chose to do and what I chose is essential. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today you have overcome your self, you have shown your self that you can do things that you thought were impossible for you, you have done all the things that you should have done, even when it looked impossible, even when you thought that your emotions will dominate your mind you didn't let them take over your mind. You chose to do this. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

You didn't learn for the tests like you wanted to. You shall do this tomorrow, but remember, that every day it is getting shorter, and you cannot escape this, you cannot run away, so do it tomorrow.  

4. **What duty remains undone?**

You didn't learn. You didn't do this because you had other things that you deemed important. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
