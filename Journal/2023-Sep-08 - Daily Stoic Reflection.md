### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> “How unlucky I am that this should happen to me. But not at all. Perhaps, say 
> how lucky I am that I am not broken by what has happened, and I am not 
> afraid  of what is about to happen. For the same blow might have stricken 
> anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation 
> and complaint.”

> [!quote]  Epicurus
> “Meditate then, on all these things, and on those things which are related 
> to them, both day and night, and both alone and with like-minded 
> companions. For if you will do this, you will never be disturbed while 
> asleep or awake by imagined fears, but you will live like a god among 
> men. For a man who lives among immortal blessings is in no respect 
> like a mortal being.”

### The Gravestone Method

> [!quote]
> What do you want to be written on your tombstone? What about what your friends will say about you at your funeral. We are dying every day. Take it further thinks about what will people remember you for, think about what would you left behind, think about what will you pass on.

When I die, I want my tombstone to say: "Freedom over death", I want to be remembered as a person, who loved others, loved life and never abandoned his ideals and belief, even when faced with a foe grater than him self a foe so great that he could never overcome him by himself. I want to leave a legacy, I want to leave a life of freedom and peace to those who come after me, help them to grow to pass on the wisdom I have.

## A VIEW FROM ABOVE

_This exercise is designed to reminded you about how small you really are, and how little importance most things have. In other words, to give you a sense of the bigger picture. It's quite simple, use your imagination to try and relate yourself to the whole world and beyond._

As I look at my self from above me, I see but one of many, one that is playing his role, he has problem, he has troubles, but they are one of many every person has. The higher I see my self form, the more insignificant I look, all is like one, no one thing works without the else. Earth now seem little, it seems small and alike to others around it, it is not special, and one day it will stop existing as well as all living things are. The space is vast, yet it has an end, what is at the end of space, is there only nothingness only darkness or is there no dark or light, that I will never know as my life is too short to know, and so is life of all human being. Some things cannot be understood by mans logic, his sciences or his mind, the things that are, yet are not. 

## MEDITATIONS ON THE IDEAL MAN

- Create a list of role models 
- Analyze what makes them ideal
