## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_
### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You may feel guild, and many other negative emotions, but they won't help you. You may be stuck in traffic, you may feel insecure, you may feel worthless, you may want to be better, you may meet people that are mean, negative, angry, unlikeable, who smell. You may be sick, tired, unhappy, lazy, you may miss your wife, you may want to hide, you may be met with difficulty, you may fail.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I choose to learn for the OSP testing, I choose to do this, so that I can get to the university I want to get on.
1. **What am I grateful fork?**
	1. For my wife, for being alive, for being me, for love, for trust, for life, for understanding, for knowledge, for peace, for democracy. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- That I will fail.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how big the failure, if it wasn't in your power, no amount of worry will save you from what you fear at failing, if you want to win, abandon your fear, only than you can be a victor, for you have no fear. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- My [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is under my control, my mind, my emotions, me. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
