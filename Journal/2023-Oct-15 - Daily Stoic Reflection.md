## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to face my self, my fears and experience negative energy from others. Furthermore, I am likely to experience bad weather and boredom. If this is to happen. I will not let my self back off from my fears, but I will face them head on. The fight against your self, is the hardest fight you are ever going to have to win.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to finish the rest of the tasks from yesterday. I must to them to sleep well at night. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my mother, for my father, for my wife, for being alive, for having enough, for being me, for knowing what is right, for trusting my intuition, for trusting my self, for being human, for having books and for having friends.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I will die forgotten. I also worried that I will lose my self and that I am not man enough for having emotions.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- When you feel your self cracking like fragile stone that fell on the ground, you must solve the cause of your suffering and understand it. None of your troubles are so bad, in fact, they are not even worth warring about.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- Only I am under my control and my [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md). All else is out of my control. I can try to make a change, but it can fail. If this happens, you will change your plans and adapt.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| -                 | -              |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| -                 | -              |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| -                 | -              |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

- Today I felt bad both physically and mentally. I did some good and learned a lot, even though it was nothing perfect. I was very spaced out and had a hard time focusing. Something is probably trying me. I will try to sleep it out and hope that tomorrow I will fell better. These events won't be seen as anything spectacular, just a normal day, even if a stepping stone to something grater.  

How I see them in the near future? 

- These events will are a lesson for me. They are meant to teach me something important, either I should rest or I should fight. But how are you supposed to know what to do? How do you choose when shown 2 paths that without a sing that tells directions? How should I know where will these paths take me?

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
