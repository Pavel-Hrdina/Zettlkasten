## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to become my own adversary, as I am likely to be lazy. I am also likely to meet arrogant, disrespectful, mean, angry and suffering people, that I must deal with today. Likewise, I am likely to experience cold, rain and failure. All of these things are but a tip of the iceberg. I could experience so much more difficulty today. My mind can't even think of all the possibilities. Now I chose to accept whatever comes into my way, whatever thorns I must push though, whatever damage to my mind and body do I must endure, I chose to live love and peace.  
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to learn when I come home, that is my only task today, that I must finish. I chose to finish this task.  
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my parents, my wife, my sister, warmth, my bed, food, being alive, being me. I chose to be grateful for all of these things and much more. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I will be hated. I am worried that I will fail, I am worried that I am not doing enough, that I cannot do the things I want to do in life, that everyone hates me. No, think, how real are these worries? Are they but a product of your mind from the ages when mankind lived in caves? Are these worries truthful? No they aren't so let go of them peacefully, let them go with love, care and peace, face your worries head on and accept them without hate, without letting them control you, so let go lovingly like the trees let go of their leaves. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how bad you might be feeling, no matter how hard your morning is, remember why are you waking up every day, remember why do you do this, why do you love all the people and all the things. You are doing this for your self, you are your greatest motivation you are doing this, so that you could become a better person for the people you love and so that you could love your self, for if you love your self, you can also love others, that is why you push forward so now go and do what you need to do. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing under my control is my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. With this knowledge I now chose to use my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] for the god of this world, to spread love and kindness to all living beings. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
