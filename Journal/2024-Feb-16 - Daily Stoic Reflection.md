## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- People will be mean to you, people will hate you, you will be stuck in traffic, you will be cold, you will feel pain, you will feel bad, you will feel, you will try to go fast, you will be tempted to make fun of your self, you will be tempted to let others step on you, you will have to resist unhappy man.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- You must chose, do one productive thing when you come home today, be it meditations, be it learning to type to reduce pain in your wrists, or be it anithing else, you must choose to do the right thing.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my wife, for my mother, for the poeple I love, for trust, for understanding, for my parents, for my mother, for my father, for being me, for love, for trust in my self, for trust in others, for being alive, for freedom, for democracy.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- Do you worry still? Do you still think it will help you somehow? Do you still have the fears of the future? I know that onlly the clearest of minds, will have no fear, but anyway you probably fear the future, so abandon the fear, you probably fear your self, so abandon the fear, abandon the fear of the past, and live happy.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how dark it seem, what problems you are facing, no matter how bad you feel, no matter any of this, feel your self and have no fear, for in death we are all equals.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- Your [[Control Over Judgment|Judgemnt]], you mind, your soul, your self.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

	You went to the gym, you have practised tiping on alternative layout so that the pain in your wrists would dissapear, you did all your duties, and you were active in school today, you never gave up, even when faced with a challange, and you were with your wife, and gave her a lot of emotionall love.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

	I didn't learn for the OSP, I didn't do what I wanted to do, I slacked off, I got out of bed late, and I broke a promise to my self.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

	Learning shiko, learning for OSP, learning how to create time blocks.

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

	Tomorrow, I shall do, what I deem my duty, and what I belive must be done, in order to improve my self.

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
