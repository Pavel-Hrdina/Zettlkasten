### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> “How unlucky I am that this should happen to me. But not at all. Perhaps, say 
> how lucky I am that I am not broken by what has happened, and I am not 
> afraid  of what is about to happen. For the same blow might have stricken 
> anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation 
> and complaint.”

### Evening

> [!quote]  Epicurus
> “Meditate then, on all these things, and on those things which are related 
> to them, both day and night, and both alone and with like-minded 
> companions. For if you will do this, you will never be disturbed while 
> asleep or awake by imagined fears, but you will live like a god among 
> men. For a man who lives among immortal blessings is in no respect 
> like a mortal being.”

## A VIEW FROM ABOVE

_This exercise is designed to reminded you about how small you really are, and how little importance most things have. In other words, to give you a sense of the bigger picture. It's quite simple, use your imagination to try and relate yourself to the whole world and beyond._

I only see what I can through the eyes of a man, these eyes, even if they are unclouded and see the present as it is, are giving but an illusion of the world. Everything exists independently, all is yet at the same time is not. If you look above, you see, but man-made objects until quite fare away. Quite a testament to the human degeneracy. The further I look, the more insignificant everything appears. Everything in the universe has existed for eons upon eons. In this cosmic wonder, all that exists on earth seems but like an ant colony. I in this play a role, I have been given life for a reason. What could this grand scheme be in a place that cannot be understood by science only thought heart and soul of all.
