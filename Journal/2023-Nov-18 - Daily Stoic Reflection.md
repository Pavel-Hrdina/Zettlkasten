## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You might be cold, You might be shouted at, You might be tempted to give up on dreams, you might have no time and you might feel down. You might get distracted, and you might even face a catastrophe, but none of these things shall break you, none of these things shall put you down, do not be broken by life, instead, chose to learn from every mistake you make, from every foolish act you do, chose to not drown in pity, instead you shall accept what is and work with it.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- You shall do what you must do, you have a list with tasks, so go and complete the tasks from the top to bottom, one by one, if you do it this way, you will be surprised how fast they disappear. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, for my wife, for my sister, for being alive, for having food every day, for being warm, for having enough, from knowing the path, for allowing my self to make mistakes, for understanding, for being so stubborn, for mentors, for the wisdom, for the opportunities, for books. You now chose to be grateful for all of these things, you chose to be happy for all the good that has happened and all the bad, you choose to let go of. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You might be worried that the opportunities, that you have chosen to explore, are wrong, that you shouldn't have done so, that you should have made different choices. Do not beat your self up for making mistakes, they are what pushes you forward, they are opportunities for growth, they are here to teach you something, so do not abandon your mistakes, accept them with grace, learn from them and use them for becoming the best. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Your problems are nothing but illusions of the mind, so abandon them, your pain is also but an illusion, so abandon it, instead, chose to look at things differently, chose to look at things as opportunities, chose to make the most from every mistake, from every wrong you have done, learn to accept them, learn to accept that you can't control anything except your mind.  
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- You can only control your [[Control Over Judgment|Judgments]], do so, do make use of it and take action when others are idle, use it to have a clear mind, use it to see the truth. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

You have made others happy, you have made your self happy, you have let your self slack off a little bit today, in order to be strong tomorrow and that's ok, you used your time well, you have balanced your life well today. All of these things you did, in order to become peace, to become unbreakable to become a beast, an unreadable one that no one will be temped to tempt into a fight.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

Today I made too many mistakes like any other day, I made my mother worry, I made my father worry, I spend little time with people that I don't have time with very often. These mistakes you made, and others, shall be the stepping stone for your future success, they shall help you make adjustments and improve your self further, they shall help you on your path to being.  

4. **What duty remains undone?**

You did all the duty you set to do today. Congratulations!

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
