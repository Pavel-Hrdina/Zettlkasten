## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	-  You may fail, you may be stressed, you may feel like you can't do it, you may feel like giving up, you may be cold, you may meet arogant, mean, angry, sad, suffering and overall bad people, you may think bad thoughts and you may feel bad. These things, you must overcome, you must choose to let them be the way they are, you can't do anithing about them, you can't change them, you can't make them into something else, you must face these things head on even if you feel like you can't, you are but a human being, so act acording to nature and you will not suffer anynore. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you don't have to do anything, you just need to be peace. So go and meditate, go into nature, go and do nothing, go and be bored, you deserve it, you worked hard.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, for my wife, for my sister and my family, for being alive, for being me, for doing what I believe is right, for acceptance, for knowing what is right and what is not, for understanding, for books, for being, for listening to my self and for all the good things I chose to be grateful. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you might fail today, that you haven't done enough, that you are weak, that no matter how hard you try, it doesn't matter. But no, think more kindly like this. One: "I did my best.", two: "No matter what I will do my best" three: "I choose to let go of worry, I chose to be free". Repeat this to your self, anytime your mind starts to become poisoned, when it feels like you're about to break, when you feel like you can't do this, think like that and think kindly.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter what, no matter how hard it might seem, you mustn't give up, you must accept what is out of your control and chose to act on what is, only then start to work, only when your mind is clear, only when you are sure you can do this. Always think like this: "I will do what works 80% of the time, then, if it fails once, it doesn't matter I will just try again, and then it will work".
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my own [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md), nothing else is, only this. Now use your judgment to take action, to do what is best and do it right. Sometimes, the best thing you can do, is to not do anything at all. Why is that? It is so because you must be 80% certain, that what you are about to do is right, otherwise, it doesn't make sense to do it.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today, you faced your feares head on, you have left behind your worry, you have accepted your nature and your ordeal, you have accpted you current self and your past self, you haven't complained and you were kind, even to your self. All of these things you have decided to do, you decided for them to be this way, you have done them, in order to controll your self and your actions. You may be thinking: "Why should I do what I choose to, and not what feels nice?". If you decide to do things for a long term, then you will see much better results over all, that if you give in to plessure, so keep this in mind.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

I deleted 3 days worth of reflections, because I was not carefull and methodicall enough, but it is ok, in the long term, 3 days are nothing. You have also gave in to anger momentarlly, before realizing your mistake, but it was too late and you have already become angry, this was because you didn't do something right. It's ok that you made these mistakes, let them be guidance for you in the future, do not make them again, then you shall punish your self harder if it will be so.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

You did all that you set out to do today, once again you prove to me, that you can do things, that you thought were impossible for you to ever do.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
