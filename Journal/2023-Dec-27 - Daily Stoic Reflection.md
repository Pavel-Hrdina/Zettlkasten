## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may be cold, you may meet people that are arrogant, unkind and mean. You may feel lost and hopeless, you may fall down and you may die. You may feel tired, and you may feel restless, and you may be bored. All of these things are out of your control, so thinks about them as such, don't let your self be bothered by them. You must choose to be fine with whatever is about to happen and what has happened. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to relax, you need to relive any and all pressure that has built up on you over the days. Chose to be in peace, to let go of anything wrong that has happened to you.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my mother, my father, my wife, my sister, my family, being me, being alive, having love and kindness, having friends, having life, having enough. For all of these things, I choose to grateful for. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you are not enough, that you will lose people you love, that you can't do enough, that you are a nobody, that you can't do what you want to do. All of these things, how real are they? How truthful are they? What do they bring you? How do they help you? You must choose to abandon these thoughts, you must choose to let them go, to leave them behind in past where they belong, you must choose to let them be, the way they should be, letting them go, letting them be a thing of the past. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how dark may thing seem, how hopeless you may fell, how bad might you think you are, nothing is worse that giving up, nothing is worse than giving up, you may feel bad that you have failed, you may feel like you are going nowhere, like you can't do anything, but no matter what, choose to see the light, choose to see what is right, what is the right action to take, what is the way you should go. Ask your self: "What could have I done better?", "Was this within my controll?".
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my controll is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. I now choose to use my judgment to act.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
