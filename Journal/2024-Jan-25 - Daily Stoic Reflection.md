## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may be a victim of change, you may feel like you have to take action, you may feel restless for it, but at the same time you may feel tired, you may meet people that are mean, unkind, unhappy and aggressive. You may also die.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, once again, you need to learn.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my mother, my father, being alive, being me, being peace, having emotions, having to struggle. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- The future, people, my thoughts, my dreams.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- What is it for a human being, when they have to take action, what is it for the mind to do this. It's change, and that is scary, because change brings things that are new, and unfamiliar. But in order to achieve greatness, you must master change 1st. So don't look at your problems with "Why me, what have I done.", instead look at them and rejoice: "I have yet to die, I still can fight, I can get back up, and do it again util I win.". That is what will push you to success, you have no idea, what strength is hidden in willpower, so gather every last bit of it, let your body go through immense suffering, then you will know willpower. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control, is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]].

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that 
everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and 
whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. For you will know that it is neither great nor lasting 
whatever you fear.[^Seneca]

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
