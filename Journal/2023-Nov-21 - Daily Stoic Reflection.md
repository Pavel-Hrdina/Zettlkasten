## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You might have to deal with your own bad emotions, you might meet people who are mean, angry and hateful, you might even be cold, you might be sick, and you might feel the pain of others. These things mustn't put you down, you mustn't give up because of them, instead use them as fuel, show them what you are capable of, show them that they are wrong, show them that you are strong that nothing can bring you to your knees in surrender and shame and fight for what you believe in, what you believe to be right. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to learn for your tests again, I know that this makes you lose freedom, that you hate doing it, that it's what kills you from inside, but that's exactly why you must choose to do it, because you need to conquer your self, you need to show your self that you can do things that you find boring. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, for my wife, for my sister, for my books, for the internet, for nature, for the food I have on the table every day, for being alive, for being alive, for being me, for education. For all of these things I chose to be grateful, for all of these things I chose to make my self better every day, to improve my self, to not succumb to the darkness but instead cling to the light at the end of the tunnel.  
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I am not enough, that my emotions are stronger than me, that I can't conquer my self, that I am not enough, that I don't belong into this world. Now think: "Are these worries meaningful, are they real, are they truthful?", the answer is probably no. So think, why do you have these worries? It's simple, you have them, because your mind wants you alive and if it doesn't make you worry that you may die from things that might happen, but these things are not real, they are only in your head, so let go of them, let them sink in the ocean of time, let them be and accept them for what they are, unreal images of your mind.  
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter what, talk to your self this way, take your time, don't make haste. Never let others put pressure on you, never let time put pressure on you, don't let these things worry your soul, don't let these things make you sad or even mad, the more you think in these ways, the more you'll fail, the more you'll suffer, so them go, let them be, the people who try to test you, who try to put you down, don't speak with them more than you have to, don't try to make them happy, don't try to fulfill their expectations. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only things within my control, is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgement]], nothing else is. So chose to use your judgement to make your life good and the life of others less miserable.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
