## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Loneliness, tiredness, fear, sadness, angryness, boredon, unhappyness, unkindness, hate, meaness, angryness, unhapiness, you may have to face your self, and your fears, you want to run, yet you can't walk.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I do what is my duty, and so it shall be done.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my mother, for my wife, for being alive, for being me, for living, for being alive, for trust, for love, for peace, and for prosperity.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- That I die, that I fail, that I am not enough, that I am lazy, that I am bad.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how hard might life seem, you must choose to see the brighter day, you must choose to see what good you have, and what good you can have, if you give up now, you will only suffer more, if you don't than you can have no regrets and be at peace, just like that, being the way you are supposedto be, being you.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- I control [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], I control my fear, I controllthe things I do, I control the things I feel, I control my self.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

	I didn't let anger take complete hold of me, and I patient, calm and loving to others and my self. Even though, you had little time, you have used it to learn for OSP, congratulations, do the same tomorrow.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

	Today, I let my self be angry.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

	You didn't learn how to do shiko

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

	Tomorrow, I will be better, that I was today, I will do my duty, without a complaint.

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future?

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
