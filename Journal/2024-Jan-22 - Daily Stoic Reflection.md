## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may meet people that are mean, angry, unkind, unlloving, and generally unhappy you may feel bad, you may be sick, and you may have to make tough desicions.  
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I need to sit down, and do nothing for at least 2 hours, then I may feel fine again. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my parents, and theyir guidance for me.
	2. For my wife, and her trust in me.
	3. For being alive, for being me, for my sister, for my family, for my teachers and mentors.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that your work is futile, that you can't do anything right, that you have made the wrong decisions, that you can't do things the way you want to. Well leave these thought behind, let them be, and let your self embrace your self with kindness, like mother nature does for all living things, do so for your self, and your heart. 
1. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how hard thing seem, keep your eyes on the light, keep watching for the truth, keep going, and then you may find your self a victor, but only then, not before, not afrer not any other time. But don't burry your head under ground, think of what has to be done and do it, take action on your dreams.
2. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my controll is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and nothing else. So use it to take action. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
