## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk  to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may find your self to be lazy, you may feel bad about your self, you may feel like you are slacking off, you may not be concentrated enough and you may fall behind.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- You must choose to prepare for the osp testing, dedicate at least two hours of time today.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my wife, for my sister, for my mother, for my parents, for being alive, for being healthy.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you can't do what is right in time, that you can't do things that you should be doing.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how much struggle you might be going, through, you must still push on. A wise man once said, if the path feels easy, it's the wrong path.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]].

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

	Today, you took some time to think, you controlled your tempter and you overcame your fears. You did this, so that you could become a better person, but it's ok, you did what you could, you did your best and that is worth something. But tomorrow, you must do more than your best, you must push your limits like never before, even if you feel so low that it will be troublesome to get out of bed, you will be victorious. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

	You were ticking a little today, don't fall back into learned habits, commit to memory what must be done, and then do it. It's what need to be done and you shall do it. I know you had no set plan for today, but don't give up on your self, you must choose to overcome who you are.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

	Today, you still didn't create your visual alphabet, and you didnt write your logbook. You shall do this tomorrow and I dare you to not do it, you must and you will choose to, you will have enought time in the morning and in the evening.

6. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

	Tomorrow, I will be my best self, I will use my energy and what I can controll do what is within my power to become my best self, I trust that I can do this.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
