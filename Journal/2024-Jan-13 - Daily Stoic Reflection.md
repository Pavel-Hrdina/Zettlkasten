## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may be sick, you may be lonely, you may feel like you can't do anything, you may feel out of time, you may feel like ticking. You must overcome all of these challenges and not give in to them, you shall win over them and so it shall be.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to learn for as long as you can, you will start at 5, and then you will win, I trust in you and you can do this.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my parents.
	2. For my wife and her love
	3. For being alive and being, for having books, computers, knowledge, opportunities, time, youth. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried, that you will fail, that you will die, or anything in between, but that is useless for you, what will it give you, what will it make you. So abandon it, it is a small death, make it go into a place that ceases to exist when the worry comes there. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how bad and hopeless you might feel, you must keep pushing on, you must not give up on your dreams, you must continue to work hard on your self and on your dreams, you must push your self to your absolute litims wihile you are still young, SO PUSH!
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing wihtin my controll is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and nothing else is, this is the only thing I have in my controll so I choose to use to take action.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

	Today, you learned for the testing. You relaxed and you were kind to all. You did all your duty, and can be proud on your self.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

	Today, you were too lazy, you didn't do some things that you should have done, well it's fine you will do them tomorrow morning then, but promise to me that you will.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

	You didn't create your visual alphabet. I didn't do my book log and learned too little. 

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

	I will do all that I left undone and I will do it in the morning.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
