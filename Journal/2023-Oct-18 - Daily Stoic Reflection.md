## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- I am likely to have a headache today. I am also likely to be unloving to others and my self. If these things happen, I will approach them with loving kindness. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to read the book. I must do this today.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my parents, my wife, my sister, the weather, cars, people, democracy, freedom, internet, computers and being me.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I will make a blunder. I am also worried that I will fail my self again. If these things happen, I will not give in, but rather face them with courage and temperance.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Today is like any other day and even if you might make some big mistakes, it does not matter because there is no other time than now and only now you can make a change. I know, but you can't really on what ifs, they will take you nowhere. You need to make a change now, otherwise you will just be there, sitting and you'll realize that you have wasted time looking for the future. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- Only your [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is under your control. You decide when to speak and what, you decide how to react, you decide how fast you go.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

Today I did these things well: I was grateful, I did what I had to, I overcame my self, I accepted my self, I respected my self and others, I didn't give up. For these things I that you, you shall celebrate on these accomplishments, that many today cannot do. Let your self relax today and tomorrow, go for a walk and yes, you don't have to, if you don't want to go.  

I did these things for I have become the conqueror of my ego, I have begun to do what the modern degeneracy cannot. I have begun to mold my self into a fierce beast that won't stop before no obstacle that is set in its path, like a falcon preying on the pest below, I will pray on the pest that is my ego and leave behind the stone that has been already carved making the stone that is left into a piece worth Michelangelo him self.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

Today I make the following wrong: I have been angry at people, I have been trying to control what is impossible to control, I have talked to match. For these things, do not whip your self. Instead, look at them and ask your self: "What can I learn from my mistakes" and "How will I avoid them in the future". They have been made, and the past is done, so now use your wrongs to reflect on them in the morning and how to avoid them.

I did these for this reason: I was loading my grip on reality, I let my self be unfocussed. I let my self be one of those who can't think, I let my self be week.  

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

You have finished all your duties today. Congratulations, go and celebrate.

I did all that I set to do today.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
