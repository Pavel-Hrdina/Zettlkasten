## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you might meet people that are mean, angry, sad, suffering and arrogant, you might be cold, and you might be hungry, you might feel sad and blue, you might be feeling pain, and you might feel anger, you might feel lazy, worthless and be loosing time. All of these things, you must accept with love and if others try to hurt you, you must love them back, if they try to hurt you again, you must set them right, if you feel a certain way, love that feeling, be peace, don't let your soul be attacked by that which is out of your control.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to be with your wife and love her. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, for my wife, for my sister, for being alive, for being me, for understanding, for my mentors, for books, for my ancestors, for knowing my worth, for finally setting my worth.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that the people around you hate you, that you can't do anything right, that you are a nobody, that you are an idiot, that you are always wrong, that no matter what you do, you never move forward. Now think, how real are these worries, what are their basis, and how did you choose to have them? None of these worries matter, think as if you could die right now, what worried would you have then, probably none, because how worries matter, if they server no purpose? So think this way: ,,I could die right now". Then you won't have any worries, and you will do what needs to be done.
1. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how dark and pointless things might seem, look deeper, look for the starts and for the light in your soul, look for the greatest qualities of your soul, imagine that you could die now, how would you think about life then? Imagine that you are about to die, what thoughts would go through your mind? You would probably try and accept your death fighting nature. So instead, you should spend your last day in gratitude and being happy. So live every day like that.
2. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing that is within my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and nothing else is.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
