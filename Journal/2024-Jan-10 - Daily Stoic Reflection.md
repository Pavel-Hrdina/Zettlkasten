## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may be tired, you may feel sick, you may be weak. You may meet people that are mean, that will hate you, disrespect you and put you down. You may be cold and impatient. All of these things you must deal with, all of these things are here to stay, and you cannot control them and if they happen or not, so don't be bothered by them and their wrong doings, let them be the way they will be.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today you need to dedicate an hour of your time to preperation for OSP testing, this shall be done today, not tommorow, not the day after, but today.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For the never ending love of my wife.
	2. For the support from my parents.
	3. For knowing my worth and what must be done.
	4. For being born and being alive.
	5. For my family. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you will fail, that you can't do what you must, that you are too lazy to do the right thing. Don't be bothered by these things, don't let them make you feel mad, or angry, or hopeless, let them sink away into the sea of nothing, where they shall be destroyed and where they shall be doomed to nonexistence. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how hard things seam, you must choose to push on, you must choose to be victorious, you must choose to win over your self, to never give up, to never give in, to be always on the top and help people get there, you must be the best, you must choose to do what needs to be done to be the best. The light, can you see it, yest I know it's very dim, but still go where it shines, go and try to touch it, walk towards it, always the same speed
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing under your control is your own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and nothing else is. So choose to take action, what else can you do that what needs to be done.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
