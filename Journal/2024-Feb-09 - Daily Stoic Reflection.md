## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_
### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You feel feel like shit, you may lose, you may fail, you may meet people that are mean to you, you may meet people, that you don't like. You may think bad thoughts, and you may feel under pressure, you may also think that you  have no time.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I need to dedicate time to learning for at least 1 hours. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my wife, for my parents, for being alive, for being me, for my mentors, for love, for trust, for peace of mind, for being me, for trust.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You are worried, that you will fail, that you have no time, that all your doings are wrong, that you will die, that you can't be happy, that you are a nobody, that you can't feed your family, that you will lose.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Yes I know that things might seem hard today, that you feel like a peace of shit, but instead of worring, instead of accepting htis as a truth, see past it, see past the suffering, and the hardness of your current condition, what do you see your self in the dreamtime, walking amist, without knowing anithing you walk, so then, if humans cannot have all the knowledge, then we shouldn't strive for it, instead, we should strive to find peace in out hearts, and live according to mother nature. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
