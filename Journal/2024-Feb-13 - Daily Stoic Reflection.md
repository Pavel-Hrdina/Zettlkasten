## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epictetus
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, I might be hated, I might not do well, I might feel lazy, I might feel pain, I might feel unwell, I might feel sick, and I might be tired.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I choose to do what is my duty, I choose to do my best, the best of my ability. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my wife, for my sister, for my parents, for being me, for being alive, for living, for trust, for happiness, for nature, for sun, for love, for peace, and for understanding. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may feel worried, that you can't do what is right, that you can't be a victor over your self, that you can't do what must be done, that you will fail, that you will die, that you will lose, that you will fail.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Banish the thoughts, banish fear, banish all that you deem a problem, leave it, for it is nothing, for you are still alive, all the things that give you fear, you will sooner or latter realize that they are but grains of sand in the sea of nothingness, and so banish them, leave them, where they shall be, and so you will be a victor, imagine life, as a desert, it's empty, and you are the one to find the oasis in it. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The onlly thing under my controll is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
