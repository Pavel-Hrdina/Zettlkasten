## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_
### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	-  Today, you are likely to find your slef in a hurry, you are likely to be lazy, your are likely to be unwilling to do anything, you are likely to procrastinate. You are likely to be stressed from your dreams.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I need to learn for maturita, by going outside and reading your notes while listening to the books you have yet to read. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my wife, for my mother, for my father, for being alive, for being me, for love, for trust, for understanding, for peace.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- That I am not smart enough, that I am not intellectual enough, that I am too lazy.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- None of the things you think are true, the only thing that is true, is that you are overthinking and thus wasting your precious time. So go, and take action.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- My [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is within my control, how I spend my time is within my control, how I choose to do things is within my control, what I choose to do is within my control. All other things, that are outside my mind, are not under my control.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
