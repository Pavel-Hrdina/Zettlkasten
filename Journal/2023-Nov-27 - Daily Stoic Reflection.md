## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You might encounter people that are mean, angry, hatefull, suffeting and generally poor to your. You might be cold, sick, in pain, suffering and hungry. All of these things might cross your path, but do not be worried by them, these things can't hurt you, if your mind dosn't allow these things to hurt you. You must become hard and no difficulty will put you on your knees then. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- You must do the practise test today. You will chose to do it after you come home from school. You know that it is hard to do it, that you don't want to do it, but you must eat this frog, you must do it allone and you will. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, for my wife, for food every day, for warmth, for being alive, for having enough, for being me, for doing what is essential, for knowing my worth, for knowing. You chose to be gratefull for all of these things.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You might be worried that you are an idiot, that you can't do things, that you are too weak, that you have nothing, that you are living in a dream. All of thes things are but an illusion of the mind, a posinous plague, trying to destroy you. So heal your mind from this plague, do not let it put you down, do not let it make you suffet. You know what the truth is, so abandon these worries. 
1. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- How many greats have come before you from Ceacar to Obama, all of them lived and died in a fraction of time so small, yet you live the same fraction as them, so tell me if the thread of time has been given to you so short, why would you think it's better to die tommorow, than today, why would you think that by living longer, now will become also longer? All of the things that exist are fleeting, so do not cling to them, even life is like that, so don't worry about your own morrtality, things and time that you have, live fully and free acording to Nature and you can die knowing that you have lived a good and full life, knowing that you have been unbroken, unshaken and that you have won. 
2. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within your control is your [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. So use it to take action, use it to live acording to Nature, use it love and live in peace and use it to leave suffering behind, let it be.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

You did well to finish all your tasks, you did well to work hard, you did well to chose what is essentiall, you did well to balance your time, you did well to take a slower pace. You did all of these things for one reason, to keep controll over your judgment, to keep you self aware and your brain healthy. Cotinue working on your slef tomorrow and then again and again and again until you are without a flaw, without darkness. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

Today you did bad to make a clowen of your self. You did this to make others happy and your self. Awoid from such behaivour in the future. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

You did all that you wanted to do today.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
