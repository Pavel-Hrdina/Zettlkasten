## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- I am likely to experience these adversities: pain, suffering, anger, cold, traffic, menses, ungratefulness, sadness, tiredness and many more that I cannot think of now. I chose to face them with calmness and peaceful loving kindness.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Toady, I chose to finish yesterday's work. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my mother, my sister, my father, my wife, rain, birds, people, kindness, love, emotions and much more.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I am sick, that I am crazy, that I hear things. I now chose to leave my worries behind and feel them with love and compassion, letting go of them.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Even in absolute darkness, you are still alive, even when you are lost in the darkest forest for days, you are still alive and for as long as you are alive you can take action and make a change to your self and others. You can make the greatest change even just before you die, your life must not be wasted for a lost cause or for a dying art, for the days of tomorrow shape the legacy of today. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- My [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md) is the only thing within my control. I chose to use my [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md) for good and peace.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today I was diligent with my self. I did this to become my best self. I chose my priorities. Furthermore, I did this to remove all the cluster from my life. I chose to pain attention in class. I made this decision, so that I would use my time wisely. Likewise, I completed what I set to complete. I did this so that I could trust my self again. I made my motorcycle working today. Furthermore, I did this so that I could be free again. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

I engaged in conversation with idiots. I did this because otherwise I would make them angry. Not only that, but I said my opinion on things I had no business in. I did this because I could not control my self. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

Today I did not complete my 2 most important tasks. I didn't do them because I was too lazy to do them. Tomorrow, you must choose to finish all your tasks from today, otherwise you are cheating your self.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
