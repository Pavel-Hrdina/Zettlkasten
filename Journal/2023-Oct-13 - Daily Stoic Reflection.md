## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	1. - I am likely to be met with a lot of criticism today. I will not let it drag me down, it will be my stepping stone to become better.
	2. - I am likely to fail today. This will be my lesson that will be another stepping stone for me to become better. 
	3. - I am likely to be distracted today. When I realize this I will reclaim my focus. 
	4. - I am likely to be cold today. I will face this cold head on. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	1. - Finish school projects so that you can focus on the bigger picture.
3. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. - I am grateful for my wife, my parents, warmth, whether, electricity, my self, my life, being alive, having enough.
4. **What is worrying me?**
	1. - I am worried that I will make a fool of my self.
	2. - I am worried that my work is no good.
	3. - I am worried that I am going to fail.
5. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	1. - You might be thinking "what if". You cannot know the future, so let your self be at peace, for you also can't control others. When you make something, and you did your best, your job is done. Use your failure as a stepping stone to build your character and your resilience.
6. **What is within my control and what is not**
	1. - My [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is in my control.
	2. - I am under my control.
	3. - All else is not under my control.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| - Today I did good. I did all of my most important tasks, I did well on a test, and I made many forward leaps. I overcame my self, I let my self follow the rhythm of Gaia | - I did these things to improve my health and the health of others this Earth is plagued by a disease that is suffering |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| - Today I chose my words badly I was not averse of the damage I could do by saying them. I also wasn't driving with focus | - I did these things because I lost my edge and wasn't aware of it quickly enough to sharpen it in time |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| - I finished most of the important tasks today, yet some are still to be done the duty that I should do in school is yet missing | - I didn't do these things because they were in the way of the important tasks |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

**Today's Events** 

- Today begun quite weird. The morning was ok, I finished my routine and everything else went normal. It was a day like any other. Except today, I made preparations for the big exclamation marks that are inevitable this year. 

**How I see them in the near future?** 

- These events will be the stepping stone for the future. Even though nothing remarkable happened today, all went well and I made no blunder. 

**How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?**

They would be seen as the events that were the stepping stones for my success. 

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
