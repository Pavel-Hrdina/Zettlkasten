## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may meet people that are mean arrogant, ungrateful, unhappy, suffering and mean. You may be cold, dizzy, in pain, sad and suffering. You may also feel alone, be criticized heavily and be attacked. All of these things are nothing, they are but a little sad in the grand scheme of things, so why let them put you down, they are nothing, if you don't allow them to be, instead of thinking: ,,Why is this like this"; Think: ,,What could I have done, to make it like this". You must choose companion to your self and allow your self to make mistakes, but make them your self.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to choose peace in your heart, you need to choose to do nothing for some time, you need to choose to meditate with your mind in deep, resting focus, then you will have energy to do things again.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, for my mother, for my sister, for being me, for my wife, for being alive, for living, for understanding, for luck, for books, for trust, for books, for knowing my worth, for knowing who am I, for finding my path, for trusting in life. I choose to be grateful for all of these things.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you have no time, that you are worthless, that you are an idiot, that you can't do anything right, that you are unkind, that you will fail. Think, how are these worries helping you control what you can control? So why don't you, instead of worrying and beating your self up over nothing, choose to tell your self: ,,How could have I done better?"; ,,How could have I made a difference?"; ,,How could have I chose a better way?"; ,,I made a mistake, how can I learn from it?". These thoughts, unlike your worries, have value, they help you learn from your past, and they are not outside your control, so learn to use them.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You may be thinking how unlucky you are, you may be thinking why me, why should I be the one to go through this. But no, think this way instead. One: ,,What was in my control that happened?"; Two: ,,What I didn't choose to do, that lead to this outcome"; Three: ,,I am unbroken, by what has happened". You must choose, instead of pitting your self and doing nothing and drowning in sorrow, instead you must choose to push your self up the mountain you have fallen down from, and again climb it, and again if you fall and again until you are dead. This mountain is you, and even if it seems that it's infinite, you can climb on the top of it, and then you will see, that the path was the victory, not the end of your journey, that the friends you have made along the way and the things you've been through are infinity more valuable than anything else.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing, that is within my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. I choose to use my judgment, to take action.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today you were kind, loving and happy, you did the best you could, and you choose to do what you believed was right, you were articulate, your self but not obnoxious, and you overcame your self, you were strong, and you had a lot of energy, you have accepted the nature of life, that people die and that you could die right now, this very moment. You walk your talk. All of these things you did, because you want to be a better person, because you want to love and to be loving, to reduce suffering to see the suffering in others and help them to be happy, you chose to not inflict pain on others, even if they inflicted pain on you and so you punish them worse, than if you gave it back to them, you try to live according to nature.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

You made some wrong choices today, you have been very sensitive and made jokes when you shouldn't have. You did these thing because that how you cope with life, thats how you disply your suffering, but that must end, instead, chose to heal your suffering in a healthy way, you must chose to live acording to nature and its laws slow and full. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

I did all the things that I set out to do today. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
