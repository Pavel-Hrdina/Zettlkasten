## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to face bad weather, failure, pain, hate, anger, idiocy, sadness and I might also face an adversity not even thought of, like a thunder or a car might hit me on the street, or I might trip and break my hand. If any of these is to happen, I shall accept them with love and open heart so that it spends to them like a contagious disease.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Toady, I chose to pick the books that I will use for my finals. I chose to do this today. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my mother, my father, my sister, being alive, being healthy, being me, having a family, my wife, warm food, warmth and for all good and luck that is to happen today, I chose to be grateful. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I will fail again, not only my self, but others also. I am worried that others see me as a privileged brat. Not only that, but I am worried that something bad is coming, my intuition is telling me. I now chose to banish these thoughts from my head peacefully and leave them behind me with ease. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter what happened to you today, you mustn't give up, you must choose to push against the crushing wheel of destiny, be like a rock that the sea continuously pound on, be like the hardest of diamonds and then no force might strike you down, no force can hurt you, no force can damage you. Become unhurtable, become the mightiest of the strong and no matter what happens then, you will be unbroken, unfazed with whomever hurt you, so push against the force that is destiny with peace, and you might as well change it.   
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- Only my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is under my control and nothing else is. I now chose to use my judgment to take action and make good. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today, I did all that I set to do, so that I could become a better human being. I chose to relax, so that tomorrow could bear fruit once again. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

I let my worries overflow, thus making me fail, this happened because I was not kind enough to my self. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

I did not pick the books, there was no time for it. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
