## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to fail a big exam, being stressed, cold, bad weather, tiredness, laziness, mean people, angry people and ungrateful people. Furthermore, I am likely to encounter anxiety and failing to take action, failing my self. This very moment I chose to accept these difficulties with calmness and understanding love, if I am to encounter them I chose to let go of hatred for them, or any sadness from them and become peace. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to learn for Wednesday tests. I now chose to do this when I come home from school and finish it in two hours or less. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my mother, my father, my sister, my wife, the things I have, the things I chose to let go off, being alive, being me, understanding, love, emotions, peace, living in Europe, living in this time, having enough, having a drive and much more I chose to be grateful for. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I will fail today, I am worried that I will fail my self again, I am worried of what others might think of me, I am worried that I am wasting my time, I am worried that if I am my self, others will hate me for it. I now chose to let go of these worries, like a bird, that lost off its feathers and now lets it slowly leave him in a peaceful motion, without resistance, without judgment. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You might be thinking: "Who am I, but a beast that only strives to live no matter how, how come I am called more than that?". But perhaps you should leave these thoughts and think again, this time think how lucky you are to be alive, how lucky that you live in peace, that you have shelter above your head and that you were lucky. Your thoughts don't shape who you are, they shape who you will become, they are the mold which your soul is chilled into, it's how you [[Control Over Judgment|judge]] your thoughts that make the quality of the work. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing that is completely under my control is my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], that is how I chose to act on the will of destiny, on the will of the infinite unknown that surrounds us with every action we take. Your [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is your key to salvation from the ugly, the bad and suffering. Nothing else you can control the outcome of.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today I did much good, I made my wife happy by being like the stone wall that she could lean on to. I chose to do this so that I could reduce her suffering. I was kind to all even to those who wronged me in the past, that includes my self, this way I can forgive everyone. Likewise, I did all that I set to do, even when tired and lazy.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

I did not prepare thoroughly for my exams for a got a good grade, there was just no time for it and tests are beginning to crumble onto me.   

4. **What duty remains undone?**

I did all that I set to do today.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
