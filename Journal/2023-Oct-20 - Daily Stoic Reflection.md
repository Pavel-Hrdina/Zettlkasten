## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- I am likely to experience distraction, laziness, cold and generally bad weather, angryness, aggression, hate, envy and many more adversities. If these adversities are to happen, I will accept them. Not that I will resignate on them, not at all. But rather that I will face these challenges head on without fear and with calmness and compassion. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I must go to my appointments.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my mother, my wife, my sister, compassion, emotions, being alive, having a future, being at peace, becoming resilient.  For all and many more things, I am grateful. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried by the future, me, hearing things and that I might be too slow. I now let go of these things that make me worry. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- The future and the past are like a gateless gate, you can see what's inside, but you cannot enter. So do not stare into the gate, for by the time you can enter, there is nothing of what you saw in there.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- My [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is under my control and nothing else. I will use what I can control to better my life and the life of others. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
