## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_
### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You may be sick, you may be stressed, you may feel unwell, you may want to quit, you may want to start again, but instead, think about the things you have done, the things you did, the things you love, and the things you want to accomplish, it does not matter that you fail, it does not matter that you lose, for as long as you can try, it does not matter, so try again, push against the threads of destiny, and do what you love and do it with peace in your heart, for a hermit will not be frightened, for he does not fear death, nor it's helpers. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I choose to learn for the OSP testing, I choose to abandon my fear, I choose to let it go.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my wife, for my mother, for being me, for being alive, for being born, for my father, for my sister, for trust, love, and mind, for people, and for life.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- That I may fail.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- So what that you will fail? How is that going to change anything? You will just try again, you will get up, and you will go back to working hard until you get it, until you emerge victorious, until then you will push against your self without fear, you must abandon it, be peace, all of this is but a mondaine thing, so think about it that way.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- Only my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is under my control.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
