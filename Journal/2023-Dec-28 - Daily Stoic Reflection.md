## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may be cold, you may fell like there is no way for you to succeed, like you are a nobody, that you can't do anything right, you may doubt your self, you may feel bad, and you may feel young and strong, you may meet people that are arrogant, mean, angry, aggressive and unkind. None of these things shall put you down, none of these things shall put your calm and happiness away, you will accept them with peace of mind and then let them go.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to do the price analysis.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my family, for my wife, for my sister, for being alive, for being me, for being happy, for knowing, for skying, for snow, for the truth, for people, for kindness, for love. I choose to be grateful for all of these things. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you are not doing enough, that you are not enough, that you can't do what you set out to do, that you can't do anything right. That you may die right now.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how dark might things seem, no matter how hopeless you might feel, no matter how deep down in fear you might be, you must look at these things and say: ,,I am not afraid of things I can't control". 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	-  The only thing in my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], so chose to use it to take action, to be a better human being, to live.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today, you were calm, collected, happy and loving. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

Today, you did not respect people who you love the most.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

Today, you did all that you set out to do. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
