## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You are likely to encounter people, that are mean, angry, aggressive, attack you, make fun of you and try to put you down and make you feel bad, make you suffer. You may also feel distracted, cold, bored, pain, and you may suffer, you may also feel lazy and tired, you may also think wrong and unkind things. All of these things, don't let your self be put down by them, let them be and let your self be the way they are, don't fight them, don't let them make you feel bad, don't be put down by them, don't be mad at them, don't be offended by them. The people who hurt you, you must choose to be kind to them and loving, think about their pain, think about how they feel, think that they are only suffering, that they try to do the same to you, punish them with being kind to them, this will not allow their suffering to touch you, and they will become desperate with time.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today you need to meditate, you must choose to meditate, you must allow your self to do so, you must accept that you might fail, that you might be wrong, and it is ok, you are only a human being, and sometimes you might be wrong, you might feel the need to shout out into the word from the bottom of your lungs, sometimes you may feel like you have hit absolute rock bottom, but what is that compared to the eternity of time, the ever expanding universe, the oneness of nature. So think like that and nothing will hurt you and you will do what you choose to do and what you choose is essential. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, for my father, for my sister, for being me, for being alive, for having food every day, for being warm, for book, for being healthy, for my luck, for being born, for freedom, for peace, for the kind and the happy, for those who helped me, for those who are an example to me. For building my self and for knowing my worth. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you are dumb, crazy, too sensitive, that you will fail, die, become forgotten, that nothing you do is worth it, that nothing you do get you any closer to your goals. But no, don't think that way, don't be put down by the poison that your mind is trying to make you believe in, rather, think this way; One: ,,Even if I shall fail, I shall play the cards that I have, and I shall not complain, about the things that are out of my control.''; Two: ,,Those who try to put you down, suffer more then you do, so be kind to them.''; Three: ,,Even in death, I shall accept my fate.''; Repeat all of these things to your self when a worry emerges in your mind bringing only pain, repeat them every day and night and then do your duty. 
1. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how bad things might seem, remember what you have, remember the light that you are chasing, remember the love you want to feel for your self and the world, remember that there are many truths, but only one at a time can be right. So think what truth is worth for me to accept and remember, what truth holds value for me, what truth will always be the truth, even after my death? 
2. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my own [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md) and nothing else is. So think deep; How can I use my judgment, to become a better human being? How can I use my judgment to do my duty? Think about this deeply, think about the ways you can use your judgment to make better decisions.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today, you did all the things that you set out to do, I was kind and loving and I relaxed, I have choosen to not let anyone ditress me, to not let the nature of things bother me, to not let anyone make me feel bad, to have a thic skin and be unbroken. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

I did almoast fall into the trap, of being emotinally manipulated. This happened, becuase I was no focuse enough, tomorrow, I must remain focused the whole day.  

4. **What duty remains undone?**

Today, you did all the things that you set out to do.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
