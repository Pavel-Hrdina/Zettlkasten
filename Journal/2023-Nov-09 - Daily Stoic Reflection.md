## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I could encounter many adversities, that no man can dream of, from sickness, to absolute soul-crushing emotions. I could encounter people who are extreme in every way and drain me from energy, they could also be mean and unkind to me. Today I could experience bad weather once again, mainly cold. I chose to accept all of these challenges with peace, love and understanding, as no matter how much I resist them, I cannot change the course of action that my adversities chose to take, so I must flow with them, flow with the rivers current, so that I don't drown.  
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to make preparations for all of my tests. I chose to do this in the evening before sleep starts to set on my eyes.  
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my parents, my sister, my wife, being alive, being me, being peace, being happy, being unbroken, being unfazed, being born, having food to eat every day, having people to love, having warmth, having opportunities, for forgiveness to my self and much more I chose to be grateful for today and tomorrow.  
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I am not doing enough, and yet I feel very tired, how come this is the case? I am worried about my wife and her feelings. Likewise, I now chose to let go of these worries, I now chose to let go. Furthermore, I let them exit my body, I let them be. I chose to accept my worries with love, kindness and understanding. I chose to accept my self with love. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You might be feeling lost, or sad, or angry, or any other way really, but now you must think to your self, how do these negative things, prevent me from taking action, how do they prevent me from controlling my judgment? And now you must ask your self, how do can I accept these emotions and let go of them, so that I can control my judgment again, how can I face these emotions with love? Even when you are lost, the Buddha in you will heal you, if you chose love to all living being and to all things, then you will be found again, rid of [[Duḥkha]] once and for all. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control, is my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], and nothing else is. With this knowledge, you know must choose, how are you going to use your judgment, to spread good to all people and to spread love.  

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
