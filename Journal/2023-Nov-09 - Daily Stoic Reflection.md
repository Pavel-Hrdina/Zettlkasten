## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I could encounter many adversities, that no man can dream of, from sickness, to absolute soul-crushing emotions. I could encounter people who are extreme in every way and drain me from energy, they could also be mean and unkind to me. Today I could experience bad weather once again, mainly cold. I chose to accept all of these challenges with peace, love and understanding, as no matter how much I resist them, I cannot change the course of action that my adversities chose to take, so I must flow with them, flow with the rivers current, so that I don't drown.  
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to make preparations for all of my tests. I chose to do this in the evening before sleep starts to set on my eyes.  
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my parents, my sister, my wife, being alive, being me, being peace, being happy, being unbroken, being unfazed, being born, having food to eat every day, having people to love, having warmth, having opportunities, for forgiveness to my self and much more I chose to be grateful for today and tomorrow.  
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I am not doing enough, and yet I feel very tired, how come this is the case? I am worried about my wife and her feelings. Likewise, I now chose to let go of these worries, I now chose to let go. Furthermore, I let them exit my body, I let them be. I chose to accept my worries with love, kindness and understanding. I chose to accept my self with love. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You might be feeling lost, or sad, or angry, or any other way really, but now you must think to your self, how do these negative things, prevent me from taking action, how do they prevent me from controlling my judgment? And now you must ask your self, how do can I accept these emotions and let go of them, so that I can control my judgment again, how can I face these emotions with love? Even when you are lost, the Buddha in you will heal you, if you chose love to all living being and to all things, then you will be found again, rid of [[Duḥkha]] once and for all. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control, is my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], and nothing else is. With this knowledge, you know must choose, how are you going to use your judgment, to spread good to all people and to spread love.  

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today I got up from my bed immediately after my alarm has rung, even though when I got up, to shut the alarm off, I felt cold, so cold, yet I made my bed and continued with my day, so that I could look into the mirror next, without asking my self: "What is my purpose, what was I put on this earth to do, why have I been born?". You see, the mind of a human being is fragile, it can be broken easily, but repair, is almost impossible. If you let your self lay in bed, still half asleep, you will fall asleep again and what then, your day is lost, your time is lost, you might feel good at the moment but once you wake up, you will become unhappy with your self, and you will blame your self for being so weak, for being so fragile, even if it's the human nature to be so, you must not succumb to the idea that doing this bears no fruit. 

I finished my routine next, after I started my day. This is crucial to me, for I need to be sure, that I can really on my self doing this every morning, that I won't let my self become the ungrateful, the arrogant, the sick. So every day, finish your routine, finish what you set to finish and do what has to be done, so that you can love your self and others.

The next good thing I did, was that I was careful when riding my motorcycle in the morning, today was cold, and I felt the need to speed so that I could be warm again, but then I chose to stay safe, I chose to live. 

I also helped my friends in need, I was kind to all and, even though I felt sick, I pushed on, so that I could love, so that I could love my self and let others love me. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

Today I did not give my all in school, and I was pitting my self, I was no humble and I let others step over me. Those who spread poison with their words, do not deserve to talk with me any more than necessary, and yet I still let them put my worth down. 

How come, I can be so blind to their trickery? How come I cannot keep my self from interaction, that is not necessary with those whose every word is like a rose, beautiful from the outside, but thorny and full of lies. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

Today I didn't make the preparation for my test next week, nor did I prepare for the tests tomorrow, nor did I finish the tasks, that I am putting off for so long. I just cannot let go of the feeling, that all duty that I must do, is taking away my freedom and my precious time, that every moment that I am not doing what I want to do, what I find amazing and worthwhile, is time wasted. 

Yet I try to make the most even from these things, that are like plague to my soul, that try to crush my will to be human, to be just a blind sheep that digs its grave, before being shot to death, there are already so many that have resignated on their life, on the precious gift they have received, a chance to achieve nirvana, to achieve the ultimate happiness.    

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

**Today's Events**

**How I see them in the near future?** 

-

**How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?**

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
