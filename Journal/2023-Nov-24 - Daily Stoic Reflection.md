## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today you are likely to meet mean, angry, hateful, suffering people, you might be cold and freezing, you might be challenged, you might think dark thoughts and feel dread, yet you must not give in to these things, instead, you must choose to push against your self, against the mountain that is in your way, to achieve what you believe in, what you feel is right. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I need to take some time to learn for university acceptance test, you shall skimp over the exercises within today and get a feel for them, do not get stuck, even if you don't understand. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, my wife, my sister, being alive, having food on the table every day, being warm, being me, knowing how to respect my self, the love I get, the people I meet, the things I can do, the life I can live and for the Buddha.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You might be worried that you are not enough, that people hate you, despise you, believe you to be an idiot, have no respect for you. Now think, even if these things were truthful, why bother your mind with them, they can't be controlled by you, or your action, so let these people think what they will, but do not be angry at them for being so, don't let them touch your heart with pain and suffering. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You are probably at one of the lover points of your existence now, you probably think how bad all the things are, how nothing is good and nothing is the truth. Now think, why do you believe this to be the case, why do you let your self fall? You must choose to overcome your problems, you must choose the path made of thorns in order to achieve the sleeping princess, yes you might die in them, but what is a life worth, when you don't do what you believe is your duty, what you believe is your calling and if you are to die along the way, so be it, the destiny of your life has already been created, you can't control this, you can't control when you die, so live like that, like you might die right now, appreciate the little thing, the things unseen to us, yet so beautiful in their own right, do not cling onto fame, wealth or the material, for in the next life, its worth the same as the nothing between the starts. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within your control is your [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md) and how you chose to use it, what actions will you take, what path will you chose to walk?
### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
