## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to be cold, almost freezing. I am likely to meet ungrateful mean, suffering and unhappy people, be bored, be sad, be angry. If I realize that one of these is happening, I will not be discouraged and will tackle these adversities by practising loving kindness. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I chose to print university acceptance tests. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my wife, parents, sister, being alive, being healthy, food, warmth, love. I am grateful for all of these things and many more. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I am not enough, that I will fail my self again. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Even in your darkest hours, you must search for the light, the light that is hope. This will be your guiding star that you must follow until you reach it, until you become one with your own soul that you have become distant from, that you have shut your self from. Do you believe that things that seem impossible may just be possible? Do you give up just before finding striking gold? You are just a human being and your goal in this life is to bring peace to others, so know that giving in to your urges, sadness and anger in moment of truth seeing, will prove to be a big blunder that you will have a hard time recovering from. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- Only my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is under my control and nothing else is. So take actin and then be at peace for nothing else is under your control.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today I went to the gym, I discovered my motorcycle has a fault and I relaxed. I did these things because I want to better my self I want to be safe and healthy, 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

I was not in control of my emotion, and I was putting my self down. I did these things because I lost control over my self.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

I must do the tests. I didn't do them because I just want to stare into the wall and do nothing.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
