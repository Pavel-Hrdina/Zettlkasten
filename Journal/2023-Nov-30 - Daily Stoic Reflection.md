## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you might be cold, you might meet people who are angry, mean, ungrateful, unhappy and suffering, you might be hungry and you might be tired. Remember that all of these things are here to help you become stronger, to become a better you. You must choose to accept these difficulties with calm and collected mind, with open mind and a calm heart, you must see the truth, that lies in these things that give you suffering. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- You must choose to learn for the test today, you must do this, so that you can become better, so that you can achieve your dreams, for you are no dumb man, you are no idiot, so go and do this thing, that you must do, today.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, my wife, my sister, being alive, being me, being healthy, having warm food every day, being warm, books, the kind, the people and life.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You might be worried that you can't do what you want to do, that you are an idiot, that you are not enough that you do not have what it takes. Now think what do these worries give you? Will these toxic thoughts help you in any way? No they will not, they are but a poison for your mind, for your very soul, so let go off them, do not be disturbed by them, do not let them make you angry, just let them go, like the birds trust the wind to carry them, you must trust your self to let you mind carry these thoughts away.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Even when tired and unhappy, you must choose to push your self harder that before, you must choose to accept that you are the way you are, and then get out of bed again in the morning and like this every day. I know that some things may be boring to you, but they are necessary, your mind has chosen them for a reason, so trust it and do what you must.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only things within my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and nothing else is, nothing else. You have the power to take action and then watch reality unfold, you cannot control anything except your own judgment.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

You made all the things that you set to do even though you are sick and don't feel so well, you have relaxed a bit, that is good, but you must know when it is time to work hard, you were also calm. You did all of these things to move your self forward.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

You have let others disrespect you, you have done things that were crazy. You did this because you did not realize in time what was happening. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

I did all the duty that I set to do today.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
