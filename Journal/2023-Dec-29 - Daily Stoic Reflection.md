## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may be cold, you may feel restless, you may feel like you are not doing enough, as if you are not doing, what you are supposed to do. You may meet people that are mean, arrogant, aggressive, angry, hateful and dislike you. You must not get discouraged by these activities, you must not give up, you must instead choose to push against the difficulty, to be better, to act.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I need to create my visual alphabet. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I choose to be grateful for my father, my mother, my sister, my wife, being alive, being me. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you are not doing enough, that you are focusing on the wrong things, that you have no time, that you can't do what you think is right.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how dark might things seem, you must keep your mind calm, you must keep your head at the moment, you must choose to take action and see the light, to push for your dream, to be free and do what you want to do.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my own [Judgment](../SLIP-BOX/Control%20Over%20Judgment.md) and nothing else is.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today, you did well all the things, that you didn't do wrong. You did all of them, because you want to be great, because you want to feel useful, because you want to live a happy live and a life of freedom and peace. What are you willing to sacrifice for this? My life, my time, my friends, fun and free time.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

Today, I was in my bed for too long, for tomorrow you will put your phone far away, so that you have to get up to stop it. I did this because I was lazy.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

You did all the things that you set out to do. I am grateful to you, that you have taken the time and energy to do them. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
