## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You may be sick, and you may feel hopeless, worthless and negative, you may feel like you can't do anything and that you are a nobody, you may feel that all of these things will hurt you. You may feel that you may meet people that arrogant, mean, angry, ungrateful and unhappy. All of these things are not under your control, you can't make them go away right at this moment, you can't control these things. So don't let them paralyze you, don't let them take away your energy, make you feel like you can't do what is right, like you cannot win over your self. So don't be put do down, because you can win over you, you can make a difference, you can do what is right, so do it!
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to take that one extra step to heal your self and your soul, so that you can fly again, so that you can push your self harder than ever before. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my parents and for their love and guidance that they offer me every day without condition, for showing me the way, for helping me find my self when I feel lost.
	2. For my wife and for her unconditional love that she gives me every single day. 
	3. For being born, so that now I can enjoy life with all its flaws and all its pain, with emotions and with struggle and peace.
	4. For being alive. For being me, for books, for life, for my ancestors.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you are not doing enough, that you are don't know anything and that you can't do anything, that you may not find the truth and that you won't fulfill your dreams. Think about these worries, what do they give you, what is their purpose? How do they help you. You may find that they don't do anything for you, that they only make you doubt your self, so let go off them, leave them behind and embrace uncertainty with love and compassion. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how dark might you might get, how clouded your thought, you must still choose to push on, to not give up on your self and on the people around you, instead be resilient, take action, do what you must and do what is needed of you and what has to be done. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and nothing else is, this is the only thing under your control so don't think about anything else and just take action. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events

How I see them in the near future?

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
