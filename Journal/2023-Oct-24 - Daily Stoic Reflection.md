## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- I am likely to encounter mean disrespectful people, bad state of being, being weak, being angry. I have to accept these adversities, I chose to approach them with loving kindness. I chose to not give in to these problems. When I feel like I am experiencing one of these problems, I chose to flow with the ebb of life and try my best at conquering them. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to go to the gym.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my wife, my parents, my sister, being alive, being peace, being me, having enough, warmth, food, smarts, nature, kindness, people, the wind, bees, sun, space, starts on the night sky, life, culture, freedom, peace. I chose to be grateful for all of these things and much more.   
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I will love, that I will lose what I have, that I cannot conquer my self. I chose to let go of these worries and continue on, get back up and continue.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- I know, you feel sorry for your self, you feel like a disgrace, like a spit on the face of earth, but a pest a rat lurking about in the shadows. But you are no pest, you are no rat, you are a man, a human. So with this understanding you must see your self as such, you are not the best so act as such, you are no god, so don't play one, you are a man. So go and use what you have been given in birth and do good, make people smile, bring them happiness and the nightmares will be gone, the self-doubt will be gone, and you will feel whole again, for this curse you have demands you to be this way and fighting against it will only bring you suffering. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- My [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is under my control and I chose to use it for good, for a better life, for humanity. Everything else is not under my control and I cannot do anything about it after I took action, everything will choose on its own, and then I can't do anything.
 
### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today I did all I wanted to do even though I was feeling sick, sad and not good. I also started going to the gym again. I did these things so that I would not give up on my self, so that I could become a better human being. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

Thanks to my illness, I was lazy and went straight into bed when I came home. I did these things because I was feeling sick and unwell. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

Today I left 4 tasks undone. I didn't do them, because I didn't want to, so I left them undone. I chose to not do them, not because I was lazy, but because I chose to not do them. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
