## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_
### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You may face your self, you may have to face your fears, and you may have to come to terms with what has to be done, you must choose between two hards, and you must choose to do the right things that must be done, you must not give up.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I need to make one last effort before the exam, I must choose to be a victor over my self, then I can be calm, I shall also learn the litany against fear word for word.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my wife, for being me, for being alive, for trusting my self, for understanding me, for loving me, for loving others, for prosperity, for peace, for human kindness.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- That I will lose.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Even those who win, must lose, those who lose, are those who have wisdom, for they know what can happen, if they do something wrong, and so they can choose based on their experience. So abandon any fear, and live with love, and kindness in heart.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- My [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is under my controll, what I choose to do is under my controll, who I choose to be is under my controll, how I react to things is under my controll. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

	Today, I have faced my fear, and I have done, what had to be done. I thank you for this, I am grateful, I thank you for doing the right things, now abandon all fear, and be at peace, for you have done all, that you could have.

1. **What did I do wrong?**

	Today, I played too much dark souls, I shall improve tomorrow.

2. **What duty remains undone?**

	I did all that was my duty, thank you.

3. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

	I will abandon all fear, leave it where no man can come, leave it where none shall enter, and where none shall live, in a place beyond life, in a time long forgotten like a bad dream, then the fear will be gone, forever trapped. 

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
