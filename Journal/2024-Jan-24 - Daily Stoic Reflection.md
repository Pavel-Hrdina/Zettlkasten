## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may find your self at the verge of breaking, you may be sick, and you may be sad, you may feel drained, and you may meet people that will only make this harder for you, they may be mean, arrogant, unhappy, unkind, and ungrateful.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, once again you need to learn for the Scion testing, I believe it is in your power to do it, I believe in you, and I believe you can and will do it.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1.  For my mother, and her love.
	2. For my father, and his mentorship.
	3. For my wife, and her never ending support.
	4. For my sister, and her kindness.
	5. For being alive, and for being born.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried, that your tiredness is not normal, that you are somehow sick, that your fever dreams are hunting you in reality. You may start to be worried that nobody likes you, that you are hated. Well why think all this, what makes you think this. This life is impermanent, and you could die any moment, right now, right at this very moment, and what would be left of you then?
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how hard might it seem, no matter how much you think you need to give up, just don't, I believe that you can do this, I believe in you, and your abilities, I believe that you can conquer your self, and achieve what you have been longing, so stop pushing your head under the sand to hide, pull it back up, and achieve your dreams.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing that is under my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. So use it and take action, take it, do not hesitate, do not be fooled, do not let others put you down for taking your mind under your own control and win.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

	Today, you were fearless, today, you had peace in your heart, even though, you woke up feeling like shit, you displayed all the virtues today.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

	Today you didn't do all your duties, you didn't listen to your self, and you spoke when others had yet to finish their sentence.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

	Today, you didn't create your visual alphabet, and you didn't learn for OSP as you promised to your self. 

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

	Tomorrow, you will do all the things that are your duty,

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
