## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to experience cold, mean people, angry people, ungrateful people, unkind people, danger on the road and laziness. For all of these things, I will react to the calmly and with precision and control.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to finish a book. I must and I will do this.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my wife, parents, cars, warmth, food, my lessons, my adversities, my mistakes, my leaning, the kind people and the smart people. I am thankful for all of these things.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I will be cold, undisciplined. I now face my fears head on.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how much you want to give up to the wits of life, you must push the head against the wall, again, again and again until there is no breath left in you. When you feel pain or cold, or you are too hot, remember that these feeling are only in your head, and they don't exist.
1. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing I can control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. I will use the control I have over my self, to make life better for those who need it and for me. I cannot control anything else outside that. Furthermore, I must not try to control these things that are impossible to control and flow with the rhythm of Gaia and life. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| -                 | -              |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| -                 | -              |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| -                 | -              |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
