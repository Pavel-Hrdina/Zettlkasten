## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to experience cold, mean people, angry people, ungrateful people, unkind people, danger on the road and laziness. For all of these things, I will react to the calmly and with precision and control.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I need to finish a book. I must and I will do this.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my wife, parents, cars, warmth, food, my lessons, my adversities, my mistakes, my leaning, the kind people and the smart people. I am thankful for all of these things.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I will be cold, undisciplined. I now face my fears head on.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter how much you want to give up to the wits of life, you must push the head against the wall, again, again and again until there is no breath left in you. When you feel pain or cold, or you are too hot, remember that these feeling are only in your head, and they don't exist.
1. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing I can control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]]. I will use the control I have over my self, to make life better for those who need it and for me. I cannot control anything else outside that. Furthermore, I must not try to control these things that are impossible to control and flow with the rhythm of Gaia and life. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

I did these and more things well: I walked my talk, I changed what I could change, I accepted my emotions, I read a book, I faced the cold, I rested, I let my self be bored. These are the things that I did well for my self. I thank you for doing them, it will pay. 

I finally accepted my self for who I am and let go of worry, so I became motivated to do what I want for my self and for others in their lives.   

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

I made these mistakes and many more: I almost gave up on my self today, I gave in to my addiction, I failed my self and I let my self do what I didn't want to.

I did them out of laziness For these wrong doing, repent. You must face your self in the mirror and forgive your self for these wrongs, for otherwise you will never let go of them and even if you forget your mind and body will remember forever, and they won't go like a mad dog that has bitten with spasm in his face now unable to let go only sinking his teeth deeper into the flesh making the wound worse and worse while you fight his teeth, making it worse, when finally you get out of his grasp only to find that you have lost. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

This duty is undone, and you must do it tomorrow: finish book notes.

I didn't do it because I procrastinated on it. Tomorrow you must remember, but do not let these tasks hunt you and rob you of sleep, as no lives matter on them and no one will die, only your soul. 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
