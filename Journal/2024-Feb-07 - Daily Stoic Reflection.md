## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_
^193c83
### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You migh die today, you might be sick today, you may find your self in a hurry, you may think bad thoughts, you may see bad things, you might be stressed, you may be feeling blue, you may not be well, you may try too hard, you may feel too fast. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I shall learn for the OSP testing once again, I will not let my self be put down, I will not let my self lose against my self, and my ego, I will win.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my parents, and their never ending support. 
	2. For my wife.
	3. For being alive, for trusting my self, for books, for people for life, for union, for being me, for the universe, for the dreamtime, for freedom.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- Failure might worry you, loss, war, hunger, cold might worry you, but instead look at your self, and think: "Can I control these things? Do I make banish them, by thinking like this?", if the answer is not, why is it, that you are worried but them? Just let them go, let them be the way they are, and then be at peace, for there is nothing that can hurt you, if your mind is as hard as diamond, for then you are unbreakable. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Can you see the light, can you? Yes, I know you can, I know that you can see what is awaiting you, I know that you want to avoid it, but that will only bring you more pain, so don't accept, what is your suffering, accept it fully, don't go away from it, go toward it, have the courage to face your fear, have the courage to do what has to be done.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- You can control only your own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgement]].

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
