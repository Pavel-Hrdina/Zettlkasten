## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_
^193c83
### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]

Tell me, what is it that you fear the most right now? Do you fear death, do you fear failure yes you do very much, you fear, that every time you do something, you may die, that you may lose, that you may fail, as you have many times before.

But tell me, what is there to fear in death? Death only brings peace and rest to your soul, it's not a punishment, but a mercy. So why fear it, it's not that you will suffer, yes others will, but everyone dies someday, so they will, if they live longer than you, suffer. So you don't have to fear that your death will bring them suffering, because it's guaranteed that people will suffer because of your death, and there is nothing you can do about it. But you may say: "So should I wish for death, then?". No, you have a duty in this life, that you must complete, and when your time comes, nature will lovingly take you back in-to it's body, that we all have come from, and you will once again become one with the planet, as your soul leaves in peace. 

What can happen if you fail at something that will not result in your death? Nothing, you may lose face, you may lose dignity, but for how long? For two days perhaps? For two weeks? Does two weeks of humiliation sound bad? Well, think, how long do you have to live? 5 more years, 80 years? You can't know, it's not in your control, you could die right now. So don't be bothered by some failure, you can always get back up, and do it again, and again, and again, and when you are dead, only then you can say down, until then chose to do what you must, and love it, let failure become a part of you, and learn from it.
### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
