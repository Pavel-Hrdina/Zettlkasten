## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- You will feel like you need to hurry, you will get stuck in a traffic jam, you will feel hated, you will be sick, you will be shouted at, hated, unliked, you will feel unloved, you will want to shout, and you will have no time, you will be scared, and you will be criticized, you will lose your self, and you will feel a longing for something deeper.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I will have plenty of time to learn. So I will, so it shall be, so it will be done, and so I shall win.
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my wife, for being me, for being alive, for having love, for having both parents, for having food every day, for the weather being nice, for the people that challenge me, for nature, for cars, for being safe, for my father, for my mother, for guidance, for emotions, for books, for freedom, for democracy.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You worry, that you will fail, you worry, that your mind is sick, you worry about the ones you love, and for their lives. You worry, that you will give up.
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You proved to your self, that you can work hard on your, you proved this to you, so don't give up on your self just yet, and push, push against the walls of destiny, decide that you can win over your self, decide, that you can take control over you, and so you can shape your reality, because if your mind is unbreakable like a diamond, so is you. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- You control your [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], your decisions, who do you talk with, who do you let critisize you, who do trust, and who do you give attention to.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

	Today, I listened to my self, and yet, I have still done, what I set out to do, not less, not more, I have been feeling very tired lately, I have been feeling hopeless, I have been felling purpose less, and so I have chosen to think, to think all day long, and so I did. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

	Today, I have given in to take revenge on those who have wronged me, I have chosen to do the wrong thing, instead of being better than then, instead of trusting my self, instead of listening to my self, I gave in. I should have punished them by being calm, and letting them be.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

	Today, I haven't learned for the testing, I didn't do it, because I am feeling completely drained out of energy. 

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

	Tomorrow I choose to take it slow, I choose to live in the present, and I choose to be better than I was today.

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
