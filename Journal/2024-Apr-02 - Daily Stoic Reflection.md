## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may find your self struggling to keep your self up on your two feet, you feel exhausted, unable to move a muscle, but why? Have you asked your self yet; why? I do not know, I have yet to understand, why is it, that I am like this. No; say instead: "How can I make this better?". You may find others mean and angry, you may find all unhappy, you may find your self sad.
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I need to finish, what has to be badly done, yet I don't want to, but I choose to, I choose to be a victor over my self, remember why do you wake every morning, why do you love all the people, why have you picked up philosophy? These are the questions, on which the answer you must remember. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	1. For my wife, for my mother, for my father, for being me, for being alive, for love, for trust, for peace, for freedom, for me, for you, for mankind, for my ancestors. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- How can I love my self?
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You know what comes after the darkness, so why do you keep on insisting that there is no light, I know you can see it as well as I do, so why do you keep on thinking, that there is no way out, no way to reach hope. Grasp for it and never let go, get up again, and again every morning, get up and do what is right, do what must be done and what is your duty, or have you been born to suffer the same blows, that you have suffered yesterday. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing that is under your control is my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]].

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

2. **What did I do wrong?**

4. **What duty remains undone?**

5. **How will I improve tomorrow?**

## Other Methods

### View from the above

> [!quote] Seneca - Letters from a Stoic
> If you want to get rid of any worry, imagine directly that everything you are so afraid of is going to happen, and whatever evil it is, measure it for yourself and estimate your fear. [^Seneca]


### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
