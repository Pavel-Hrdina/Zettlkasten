## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may be a subject to hate, to lack of love and kindness both from your self and others, you may feel like you have failed your self, you may feel, that you are no good, that you are worthless, you may feel lazy and as if you were sick, you may be cold, and you may meet people that are arrogant, unkind, hateful, mean and lying. All of these things are only there, because nature made them so, they are not like this, because they would want to be like that, they didn't choose their actions, for they are blind to who they are, they do not know of their Buddha nature hidden within them, yet you may feel hurt by them, but remember, what is hurt compared to the fact that you could die at this moment, you could die anytime, then what is worry worth, then what is anger worth, then what is wasting time worth, then what is being passive and unhappy worth? You don't know what comes after death, so let go of all of these worthless things, for they are worth nothing, not even your time, they don't help you to be happy, they don't help you live your life, they only set you back and make you suffer, remember the words of the Gautama Buddha. You must choose to help others who are suffering to find peace in their heart
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to write the email to your teacher. You shall do this in the morning, when you still have time, when you still know what is worth your time and what is not, when your mind is still clear and when you are still alive.  
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- For my parents, for my sister, for my wife, for being alive, for being me, for nature, for the Buddha, for the three jewels, for the mind, for happiness, for emotions, for understanding, for suffering, for books, for my ancestors. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried that you will end up on the streets, that you are not fit for life, that you are not made for this life, that you are too lazy, that you have no future, that you know nothing, that you are nothing, that there is no meaning in life. Yes, it is true that life has no meaning, because you have to find it for your self, life has no rules, life has no best way, the only thing that you must do in life, is to live according to nature and live so that you can die in peace. How do you know that all of those future things hold any truth in them? How do you know that those things are right, how do you know, that they are the truth? These things might happen in the future, but they are not happening now and how do they matter then, if you don't even have any concrete basis for their truth and even if you had, instead of worry, you should start solving these problems now. So stop working and start living. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter what darkness plagues your mind, always look for the light, no matter what is bothering you, always look for the bright stars in the sky and thing: ,,What am I, how small compared to the infinity of the universe, to the infinity of time." and then think how lucky you are to be alive, how lucky you are to be born, how lucky you are to suffer, how lucky you are to have an interesting life, how lucky that you are not broken by the past. And then understand what you have been though already, what difficulties have you overcome how you fight every day to become more compassionate, to become more loving, to become better, how you choose the difficult, how you choose to live your life the hard and the right way, to spread love and compassion to all beings until you are dead, you will be forgotten with time anyway, so what does it matter if you think you have problems now, they will go away with time, like all things do.  
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and nothing else is. So now use your judgment for compassion, love and the virtues, live your life according so that you can be happy. Some feel a deep hole within their soul, like a mine that has been dug by suffering, they only way to fill this hole, is to live your life in kindness to others and with love to them and your self.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

Today, you have chosen to be kind, you have chosen to be loving and banish your rage to those who wronged you, to those who tried to hurt you, to those, who laughed at you, you have chosen to accept whatever comes in your way, and you have chosen to never let anybody walk onto you like on a rug. You did these things, so that you could walk free amongst the chained sheep, so that you could live your life happy and without regret, so that you could know that you were good to those who loved you and those who hated you, that you could die in peace, as if you would die now.

2. **What did I do wrong?**

You were too angry today, especially at your self, you called your self dumb and was angry about your mistakes. You did this because you have chosen to give into rage, to be hateful to your self. Remember that making a mistake does not mean that you are an idiot, that you are worthless, that you can't do anything, it only means, that you must learn from that mistake and do it again, until you do it right, only then you will find your self at peace. 

4. **What duty remains undone?**

You did all that you set out to do today. Thank you for doing your duty, 

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
