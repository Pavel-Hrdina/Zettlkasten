## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today I am likely to meet crazy people on the road. I am likely to meet suffering and sadness in people. I am likely to suffer my self. I am likely to be lazy and I am likely to be hungry. All of these difficulties will not stand in my way and I will conquer them and my self. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to relax a bit. Enjoy nature, the sound of the birds humming their little songs, and let go of worry. You choose to do these things today.  
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my wife, my parents, my education, my sister, being alive, the weather, the warmth, my space, the clothing I wear, the person I am, life and all the other little things.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that none likes me. I am worried that I am an imposter. Furthermore, I am worried that I do not deserve my life. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- You, my friend, might think that you are the dumbest person alive, that you don't belong, but why? Is it because people are mean to you, and you are so sensitive to their criticism. Or is it because you are falling into bad habits again, or is it because you feel like you know nothing. Well, none of these things are true. You must choose to trust your self and others, if you can't trust anybody, than you can't trust your self. It takes a lot of courage to trust someone, especially if you've been betrayed so many times before. I know you see the world as a dark place full of horror, corruption and absolute hell, and maybe you are right. But if you can make life good for your self and others, you can reduce this suffering that the world is in. Every day so many suffer fates worse than death, those stories are not heard and are not seen. We are shielded from them, kept in our little bubbles, thinking that the dark ages are long gone. But the human race didn't change its ways. You are cursed to be so sensitive, but you must use this curse to heal the suffering you see in others, only then you will find your peace, now you have found your mission on this earth. So then be at peace, you know what you have to do. Be kind to all, even those who are trying to hurt you, trying to break you, you must choose to resist their pain and heal their wounds. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing in my control is my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and so use this to ripple healing into the world. Nothing else can be controlled outside that after you took action resulting from your [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]].

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
