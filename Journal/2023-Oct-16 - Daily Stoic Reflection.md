## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today will be cold and people will be mean because of it, I won't let this affect me however, it is out of my control and out of what is possible for me to control. Furthermore, it is also possible that I will be tempted to be stress by what is out of my control, in this case I will realize it and gain control back. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today I have to finish a task that I have been putting off for some time now. I will do these task with diligence and preciseness. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my Parents, because they are so kind and supportive to me. I am grateful for my wife, she is kind and nice even when she doesn't feel so well her self. She is also so beautiful and intelligent. I am grateful for the food and warmth I have. I could be starving, and freezing to death right now if I was so unlucky to be born else where. Furthermore, I am also grateful for my ancestors. They were the ones who carved the way for us.
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I will be too lazy to do what I have to do. I am worried that I am heading on the wrong path. Furthermore, I am also worried that my will be hit with the compound effect. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Every day, be like a mountain. Unmovable and unbreakable. Be the biggest, harshest mounting, then you will be impossible to climb on. Never let go of your dignity. Never make a fool out of your self. You think that these problems are bad, but you are going to die anyway, so you might as well do your best at it. You can't control the future, let go of worrying about the uncontrollable, it is unwise.  
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- Only my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] is withing my control and nothing else is.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

Today, you weren't able to do what you became accustomed to do. You set your routine successfully, yet you lost ink in your pen, and you bought the wrong replacement for it, now you cannot learn to write better, and you can't write your thoughts down, and it's becoming tiring. For some weird reason, it is very comforting to remove the cluster you have in your mind and put it away, just like that, and it's gone. You also experienced mean people, but you were calm when dealing with them. Today wasn't the easiest of days for you, but the anger you felt, was nothing short of bothersome. All of these things were out of your control, so why did your mind stayed with them all day. So why can't you let go of these things, you cannot change them, so let them change you to become better, to become smarter and to become stronger. You know your worth, so why do you let others belittle you for being authentic. 

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
|  I did well today when it comes to me. I successfully controlled my judgment. I did not masturbate  | I did this to carve my self into a diamond |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| I was not in control of my anger and my self. I also bought the wrong ink for my pen | I was in a hurry and my emotions were strong today |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| I did all that I had to do today | ... |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
