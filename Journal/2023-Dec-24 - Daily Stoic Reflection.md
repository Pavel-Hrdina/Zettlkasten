## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, you may be cold, you may feel pressure, you may feel restless, and you may feel worthless and down, you may be tired, and you may feel like you don't deserve the gifts you are about to get, you may fell, as if you have hurt somebody, as if you made a mistake as if you have no energy. These things are only temporary, they cannot hurt you, if you don't choose to be hurt by them, instead, chose to let them be the way they are, then, you will see them go away with time, like the mother earth takes back all, that has been landed life, slowly but surely, lovingly accepting its children back into the soil. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, you need to relax, let the holiday relax you. Let go of worry and then be happy, for what reason is there to be worried and sad, if you could die right now, at this very moment.  
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I chose to be grateful for my mother, my father, my sister, my wife, my life, being alive, being me, being born, having food on the table every day, having peace in my heart and being happy, these things I chose to be grateful for. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- You may be worried, that if you relax, you fail, you give up, like you always did, you may be worried that you will become your past self again, that you will hurt people, that you are not doing enough. Now think, what do these worries help you with? How do they help you be happy, how do they help you live according to nature, how do they help you accept your mortality? You may know in your mind that these worries are not true, but your heart is telling you otherwise, so you ask, how do I let my heart accept the truth? The answer is, to feel the worry in your heart, to close your eyes and focus on the worry, as if it were in your mind, but instead it is in your heart, and then imagine your suffering falling down from your heart, away from your body, like a waterfall. As you let go with every breath, the suffering and worry disappears. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- No matter what darkness plagues your mind, always choose to see the light, always choose to push for happiness, for a fulfilled life, so that you can say to your self, I live my best life, that I have lived good and that I can die right now without regret, only then you will live with peace. 
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	-  The only thing, that is within my own control is my own [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]], so choose to use it to take action, to be a better human being, to relive the suffering of others that you see in them every day, it is not that they hurt you, it is their suffering that hurts you, so choose to help them and choose to help you self to be free of it.

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

| Things I Did Well | Why I did them |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

2. **What did I do wrong?**

| What did I do wrong | Why I did it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

4. **What duty remains undone?**

| What duty remains undone? | Why I didn't do it |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
