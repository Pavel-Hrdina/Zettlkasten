## Morning and Evening

> [!quote] Epicious 
> _"Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand - write them, read them aloud, talk your yourself and others about them"_

### Morning

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> "Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet. I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all! Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone, but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint."

1. **What difficulties am I likely to encounter today?**
	- Today, I am likely to experience the following adversities: difficulties adjusting to change, having a bad mood, being angry, people being mean, sadness, uncertainty, self-doubt, low self-esteem, laziness and my self. 
2. **What one thing do most need to get done today?**
	- Today, I chose to be bored. 
1. **What am I grateful for?**
	- I am grateful for my wife, my sister, my parents, the weather, technology, nature, people, my self, being alive, being healthy, learning, life, ancestors and many more. For all of these things, I choose to be grateful. 
2. **What is worrying me?**
	- I am worried that I am dumb, mean and too sensitive. I am also worried that people hate me, and I am scared of change. Furthermore, I now chose to accept my worries and let go of them, as if they were a feather falling down on the ground. Slowly but surely I let the feather drop and leave me. 
3. **How can I decatastrophize today's problems?**
	- Even when things see so bad that you think: "Why am I alive?", you must choose to think about how lucky you are that you are still alive. Perhaps think that all you did today, will help you become better tomorrow and now. Yes I know that you feel bad, and your body is hurting you feel sick, but all of this will go away so don't fight it don't push against the river current flow with it, let your self become free like the hawk looking down from far away perhaps he is thinking how small it all looks, or he does not know it at all that what is beneath him is magnificent.
4. **What is within my control and what is not**
	- The only thing within my [[Control Over Judgment|Judgment]] and that is my biggest strength. 

### Evening

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> Let not sleep descend on your weary eyes before having reviewed every action of the day. Where did I go wrong? What did I do right? What did I leave undone? Starting here, review your actions, and afterward, blame yourself for what is badly done, and rejoice in the good.

1. **What did I do well today?**

I remained calm in the face of adversity, I remained calm in the face of anger, I remained in control of my self, I supported my girlfriend and I listened to my body. I did all of these things to become a better human being. 

2. **What did I do wrong?**

I was mean to my wife, I didn't control my boredom, I was talking too little. I did these things because I lost control over my self, and I am sorry for that to you.

4. **What duty remains undone?**

I had no task that had to be done today.

## Other Methods

### Gravestone Method

> [!quote] Marcus Aurelius
> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind - things that exist only there. And you will immediately make vast space for yourself by grasping the whole universe in your thoughts, by contemplating the eternity of time, and by reflecting on the speed with which things change - each part of everything, the brief gap from birth to death, the infinite time before, and the equality infinite time that follows. 

Today's Events 

-

How I see them in the near future? 

-

How they'd be viewed, years after I've passed?

### 4 Virtues Method

> [!quote] Epictetus 
> If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.
